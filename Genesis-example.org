* Genesis 1

** The Creation

<<1:1>> *1* In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.

<<1:2>> *2* Now the earth was formless and void, and darkness was over the surface of the deep. And the Spirit of God was hovering over the surface of the waters.

<<1:3>> *3* And God said, "Let there be light," and there was light.

<<1:4>> *4* And God saw that the light was good, and He separated the light from the darkness.

<<1:5>> *5* God called the light "day," and the darkness He called "night." And there was evening, and there was morning—the first day.

<<1:6>> *6* And God said, "Let there be an expanse between the waters, to separate the waters from the waters."

<<1:7>> *7* So God made the expanse and separated the waters beneath it from the waters above. And it was so.

<<1:8>> *8* God called the expanse "sky." And there was evening, and there was morning—the second day.

* Genesis 2

** The Seventh Day

<<2:1>> *1* Thus the heavens and the earth were completed in all their vast array.

<<2:2>> *2* By the seventh day God had finished the work He had been doing; so on that day He rested from all His work.

<<2:3>> *3* Then God blessed the seventh day and sanctified it, because on that day He rested from all the work of creation that He had accomplished.

** The Creation of Man

<<2:4>> *4* This is the account of the heavens and the earth when they were created, in the day that the LORD God made them.

<<2:5>> *5* Now no shrub of the field had yet appeared on the earth, nor had any plant of the field sprouted; for the LORD God had not yet sent rain upon the earth, and there was no man to cultivate the ground.

<<2:6>> *6* But springs welled up from the earth and watered the whole surface of the ground.

<<2:7>> *7* Then the LORD God formed man from the dust of the ground and breathed the breath of life into his nostrils, and the man became a living being.

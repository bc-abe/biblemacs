This is my Emacs Setup for studying the Bible. 

To start install
- [[https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/releases/download/v3.4.0/CascadiaCode.zip][CaskaydiaCove Nerd Font]]
- [[https://github.com/googlefonts/roboto-2/releases/download/v2.138/roboto-unhinted.zip][Roboto Font]]
- [[https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git][Git]]
- Optional: [[https://bibletime.info/][BibleTime]] (Download the Berean Standard Bible in BibleTime)

To get this up and running tangle the file code/init.org with ~C-c C-v t~
 
Or, run this in your terminal after cloning the repo:

~emacs --batch --eval "(require 'org)" --eval "(org-babel-tangle-file \"~/biblemacs/code/init.org\")"~


I'll have more stuff later, but that's what I have for now.

Here are keybindings to start. Leader key is ~Alt-SPC~. In Emacs, ~Alt~ is ~M~. So go a bible reference is ~Alt + Spacebar~, then ~b~, and ~f~, put Acts 2:38. The ta-da! you should be at Acts 2:38.

Note: to use ~sword-insert-ref~ and other ~sword~ commands, install BibleTime.
 
Here are the basics

#+begin_src 
M-SPC f f find file
M-SPC f s save file
M-SPC b f find Bible Reference
M-SPC b s search whole bible
M-SPC b l insert bible link
M-SPC n f create/find note
M-SPC n i insert note link

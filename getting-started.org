* Welcome to BibleMacs!

BibleMacs is a specialized Emacs distribution designed specifically for Bible study. This guide will help you understand how to use BibleMacs effectively, even if you've never used Emacs before.

* What is BibleMacs?

BibleMacs transforms Emacs into a powerful Bible study tool with features like:
- Quick Bible navigation and searching
- Note-taking system integrated with Bible verses
- Inductive Bible study templates
- Project management for sermons, articles, and lectures
- Website generation for sharing your studies

* First Things First

** Understanding the Basics

BibleMacs uses keyboard shortcuts (called "key bindings") for most actions. Don't worry - you'll learn them quickly!

*** The Leader Key
The most important key combination is *Control + Space* (written as ~C-SPC~). This is your "leader key" that starts most commands.

*** Basic Navigation
- Use arrow keys to move around
- ~C-x C-s~ saves your current file
- ~C-x C-c~ exits Emacs (it will ask to save unsaved work)
- ~C-g~ cancels any command you're in the middle of

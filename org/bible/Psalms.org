* Psalm 1
[[html-class:drop][1]]
<<1:1>> Blessed is the man \\
who does not walk in the counsel of the wicked, \\
or set foot on the path of sinners, \\
or sit in the seat of mockers.  \\
<<1:2>> *2* But his delight is in the Law of YHWH, \\
and on His law he meditates day and night.  \\
<<1:3>> *3* He is like a tree planted by streams of water, \\
yielding its fruit in season, \\
whose leaf does not wither, \\
and who prospers in all he does. \\
<<1:4>> *4* Not so the wicked! \\
For they are like chaff driven off by the wind.  \\
<<1:5>> *5* Therefore the wicked will not stand in the judgment, \\
nor sinners in the assembly of the righteous. \\
<<1:6>> *6* For YHWH guards the path of the righteous, \\
but the way of the wicked will perish. \\

* Psalm 2
[[html-class:drop][2]]
<<2:1>> Why do the nations rage \\
and the peoples plot in vain? \\
<<2:2>> *2* The kings of the earth take their stand \\
and the rulers gather together, \\
against YHWH \\
and against His Anointed One: \\
<<2:3>> *3* “Let us break Their chains \\
and cast away Their cords.” \\
<<2:4>> *4* The One enthroned in heaven laughs; \\
the Lord taunts them. \\
<<2:5>> *5* Then He rebukes them in His anger, \\
and terrifies them in His fury: \\
<<2:6>> *6* “I have installed My King on Zion, \\
upon My holy mountain.” \\
<<2:7>> *7* I will proclaim the decreespoken to Me by YHWH: \\
“You are My Son; \\
today I have become Your Father. \\
<<2:8>> *8* Ask Me, and I will make the nations Your inheritance, \\
the ends of the earth Your possession. \\
<<2:9>> *9* You will break them with an iron scepter; \\
You will shatter them like pottery.” \\
<<2:10>> *10* Therefore be wise, O kings; \\
be admonished, O judges of the earth. \\
<<2:11>> *11* Serve YHWH with fear, \\
and rejoice with trembling. \\
<<2:12>> *12* Kiss the Son, lest He be angry \\
and you perish in your rebellion, \\
when His wrath ignites in an instant. \\
Blessed are all who take refuge in Him.. \\

* Psalm 3
[[html-class:drop][3]]
<<3:1>> O YHWH, how my foes have increased! \\
How many rise up against me! \\
<<3:2>> *2* Many say of me, \\
“God will not deliver him.” \\
#+begin_center
Selah \\
#+end_center
<<3:3>> *3* But You, O YHWH, are a shield around me, \\
my glory, and the One who lifts my head. \\
<<3:4>> *4* To YHWH I cry aloud,and He answers me from His holy mountain. \\
Selah \\
<<3:5>> *5* I lie down and sleep; \\
I wake again, for YHWH sustains me. \\
<<3:6>> *6* I will not fear the myriads \\
set against me on every side. \\
<<3:7>> *7* Arise, O YHWH! \\
Save me, O my God! \\
Strike all my enemies on the jaw; \\
break the teeth of the wicked. \\
<<3:8>> *8* Salvation belongs to YHWH; \\
may Your blessing be on Your people. \\
* Psalm 4

[[html-class:drop][4]]
<<4:1>> Answer me when I call, \\
O God of my righteousness! \\
You have relieved my distress; \\
show me grace and hear my prayer.  \\
<<4:2>> *2* How long, O men, will my honor be maligned? \\
How long will you love vanity and seek after lies? \\
#+begin_center
Selah  \\
#+end_center
<<4:3>> *3* Know that YHWH has set apart the godly for Himself; \\
YHWH hears when I call to Him.  \\
<<4:4>> *4* Be angry, yet do not sin; \\
on your bed, search your heart and be still. \\
#+begin_center
Selah  \\
#+end_center
<<4:5>> *5* Offer the sacrifices of the righteous \\
and trust in YHWH.  \\
<<4:6>> *6* Many ask, “Who can show us the good?” \\
Shine the light of Your face upon us, O YHWH.  \\
<<4:7>> *7* You have filled my heart with more joy \\
than when grain and new wine abound.  \\
<<4:8>> *8* I will lie down and sleep in peace, \\
for You alone, O YHWH, make me dwell in safety.  \\
* Psalm 5

[[html-class:drop][5]]
<<5:1>> Give ear to my words, O YHWH; \\
consider my groaning.  \\
<<5:2>> *2* Attend to the sound of my cry, \\
my King and my God, \\
for to You I pray.  \\
<<5:3>> *3* In the morning, O YHWH, You hear my voice; \\
at daybreak I lay my plea before You \\
and wait in expectation.  \\
<<5:4>> *4* For You are not a God who delights in wickedness; \\
no evil can dwell with You.  \\
<<5:5>> *5* The boastful cannot stand in Your presence; \\
You hate all workers of iniquity.  \\
<<5:6>> *6* You destroy those who tell lies; \\
YHWH abhors the man of bloodshed and deceit.  \\
<<5:7>> *7* But I will enter Your house \\
by the abundance of Your loving devotion; \\
in reverence I will bow down \\
toward Your holy temple.  \\
<<5:8>> *8* Lead me, O YHWH, in Your righteousness \\
because of my enemies; \\
make straight Your way before me.  \\
<<5:9>> *9* For not a word they speak can be trusted; \\
destruction lies within them. \\
Their throats are open graves; \\
their tongues practice deceit.  \\
<<5:10>> *10* Declare them guilty, O God; \\
let them fall by their own devices. \\
Drive them out for their many transgressions, \\
for they have rebelled against You.  \\
<<5:11>> *11* But let all who take refuge in You rejoice; \\
let them ever shout for joy. \\
May You shelter them, \\
that those who love Your name may rejoice in You.  \\
<<5:12>> *12* For surely You, O YHWH, bless the righteous; \\
You surround them with the shield of Your favor.  \\
* Psalm 6

[[html-class:drop][6]]
<<6:1>> O YHWH, do not rebuke me in Your anger \\
or discipline me in Your wrath.  \\
<<6:2>> *2* Be merciful to me, O YHWH, for I am frail; \\
heal me, O YHWH, for my bones are in agony.  \\
<<6:3>> *3* My soul is deeply distressed. \\
How long, O YHWH, how long?  \\
<<6:4>> *4* Turn, O YHWH, and deliver my soul; \\
save me because of Your loving devotion.  \\
<<6:5>> *5* For there is no mention of You in death; \\
who can praise You from Sheol?  \\
<<6:6>> *6* I am weary from groaning; \\
all night I flood my bed with weeping \\
and drench my couch with tears.  \\
<<6:7>> *7* My eyes fail from grief; \\
they grow dim because of all my foes.  \\
<<6:8>> *8* Depart from me, all you workers of iniquity, \\
for YHWH has heard my weeping.  \\
<<6:9>> *9* YHWH has heard my cry for mercy; \\
YHWH accepts my prayer.  \\
<<6:10>> *10* All my enemies will be ashamed and dismayed; \\
they will turn back in sudden disgrace. \\
* Psalm 7

[[html-class:drop][7]]
<<7:1>> O YHWH my God, I take refuge in You; \\
save me and deliver me from all my pursuers,  \\
<<7:2>> *2* or they will shred my soul like a lion \\
and tear me to pieces with no one to rescue me.  \\
<<7:3>> *3* O YHWH my God, if I have done this, \\
if injustice is on my hands,  \\
<<7:4>> *4* if I have rewarded my ally with evil, \\
if I have plundered my foe without cause,  \\
<<7:5>> *5* then may my enemy pursue me and overtake me; \\
may he trample me to the ground \\
and leave my honor in the dust. \\
Selah  \\
<<7:6>> *6* Arise, O YHWH, in Your anger; \\
rise up against the fury of my enemies. \\
Awake, my God, and ordain judgment.  \\
<<7:7>> *7* Let the assembled peoples gather around You; \\
take Your seat over them on high.  \\
<<7:8>> *8* YHWH judges the peoples; \\
vindicate me, O YHWH, \\
according to my righteousness and integrity.  \\
<<7:9>> *9* Put an end to the evil of the wicked, \\
but establish the righteous, \\
O righteous God who searches hearts and minds.  \\
<<7:10>> *10* My shield is with God, \\
who saves the upright in heart.  \\
<<7:11>> *11* God is a righteous judge \\
and a God who feels indignation each day.  \\
<<7:12>> *12* If one does not repent, \\
God will sharpen His sword; \\
He has bent and strung His bow.  \\
<<7:13>> *13* He has prepared His deadly weapons; \\
He ordains His arrows with fire.  \\
<<7:14>> *14* Behold, the wicked man travails with evil; \\
he conceives trouble and births falsehood.  \\
<<7:15>> *15* He has dug a hole and hollowed it out; \\
he has fallen into a pit of his own making.  \\
<<7:16>> *16* His trouble recoils on himself, \\
and his violence falls on his own head.  \\
<<7:17>> *17* I will thank YHWH for His righteousness \\
and sing praise to the name of YHWH Most High. 
* Psalm 8

[[html-class:drop][8]]

<<8:1>> O YHWH, our Lord, \\
how majestic is Your name in all the earth! \\
You have set Your glory \\
above the heavens.  \\
<<8:2>> *2* From the mouths of children and infants \\
You have ordained praise \\
on account of Your adversaries, \\
to silence the enemy and avenger.  \\
<<8:3>> *3* When I behold Your heavens, \\
the work of Your fingers, \\
the moon and the stars, \\
which You have set in place—  \\
<<8:4>> *4* what is man that You are mindful of him, \\
or the son of man that You care for him?  \\
<<8:5>> *5* You made him a little lower than the angels; \\
You crowned him with glory and honor.  \\
<<8:6>> *6* You made him ruler of the works of Your hands; \\
You have placed everything under his feet:  \\
#+begin_notesijk  \\
<<8:9>> *9* O YHWH, our Lord, \\
how majestic is Your name in all the earth!  \\

* Psalm 9

[[html-class:drop][9]]
<<9:1>> I will give thanks to YHWH with all my heart; \\
I will recount all Your wonders.  \\
<<9:2>> *2* I will be glad and rejoice in You; \\
I will sing praise to Your name, O Most High.  \\
<<9:3>> *3* When my enemies retreat, \\
they stumble and perish before You.  \\
<<9:4>> *4* For You have upheld my just cause; \\
You sit on Your throne judging righteously.  \\
<<9:5>> *5* You have rebuked the nations; \\
You have destroyed the wicked; \\
You have erased their name forever and ever.  \\
<<9:6>> *6* The enemy has come to eternal ruin, \\
and You have uprooted their cities; \\
the very memory of them has vanished.  \\
<<9:7>> *7* But YHWH abides forever; \\
He has established His throne for judgment.  \\
<<9:8>> *8* He judges the world with justice; \\
He governs the people with equity.  \\
<<9:9>> *9* YHWH is a refuge for the oppressed, \\
a stronghold in times of trouble.  \\
<<9:10>> *10* Those who know Your name trust in You, \\
for You, O YHWH, have not forsaken those who seek You.  \\
<<9:11>> *11* Sing praises to YHWH, who dwells in Zion; \\
proclaim His deeds among the nations.  \\
<<9:12>> *12* For the Avenger of bloodshed remembers; \\
He does not ignore the cry of the afflicted.  \\
<<9:13>> *13* Be merciful to me, O YHWH; \\
see how my enemies afflict me! \\
Lift me up from the gates of death,  \\
<<9:14>> *14* that I may declare all Your praises— \\
that within the gates of Daughter Zion \\
I may rejoice in Your salvation.  \\
<<9:15>> *15* The nations have fallen into a pit of their making; \\
their feet are caught in the net they have hidden.  \\
<<9:16>> *16* YHWH is known by the justice He brings; \\
the wicked are ensnared by the work of their hands. \\
Higgaion \\
Selah  \\
<<9:17>> *17* The wicked will return to Sheol— \\
all the nations who forget God.  \\
<<9:18>> *18* For the needy will not always be forgotten; \\
nor the hope of the oppressed forever dashed.  \\
<<9:19>> *19* Rise up, O YHWH, do not let man prevail; \\
let the nations be judged in Your presence.  \\
<<9:20>> *20* Lay terror upon them, O YHWH; \\
let the nations know they are but men. \\
Selah  \\
* Psalm 10

[[html-class:drop][10]]
<<10:1>> Why, O YHWH, do You stand far off? \\
Why do You hide in times of trouble?  \\
<<10:2>> *2* In pride the wicked pursue the needy; \\
let them be caught in the schemes they devise.  \\
<<10:3>> *3* For the wicked man boasts in the cravings of his heart; \\
he blesses the greedy and reviles YHWH.  \\
<<10:4>> *4* In his pride the wicked man does not seek Him; \\
in all his schemes there is no God.  \\
<<10:5>> *5* He is secure in his ways at all times; \\
Your lofty judgments are far from him; \\
he sneers at all his foes.  \\
<<10:6>> *6* He says to himself, “I will not be moved; \\
from age to age I am free of distress.”  \\
<<10:7>> *7* His mouth is full of cursing, deceit, and violence; \\
trouble and malice are under his tongue.  \\
<<10:8>> *8* He lies in wait near the villages; \\
in ambush he slays the innocent; \\
his eyes watch in stealth for the helpless.  \\
<<10:9>> *9* He lies in wait like a lion in a thicket; \\
he lurks to seize the oppressed; \\
he catches the lowly in his net.  \\
<<10:10>> *10* They are crushed and beaten down; \\
the hapless fall prey to his strength.  \\
<<10:11>> *11* He says to himself, “God has forgotten; \\
He hides His face and never sees.”  \\
<<10:12>> *12* Arise, O YHWH! Lift up Your hand, O God! \\
Do not forget the helpless.  \\
<<10:13>> *13* Why has the wicked man renounced God? \\
He says to himself, “You will never call me to account.”  \\
<<10:14>> *14* But You have regarded trouble and grief; \\
You see to repay it by Your hand. \\
The victim entrusts himself to You; \\
You are the helper of the fatherless.  \\
<<10:15>> *15* Break the arm of the wicked and evildoer; \\
call him to account for his wickedness \\
until none is left to be found.  \\
<<10:16>> *16* YHWH is King forever and ever; \\
the nations perish from His land.  \\
<<10:17>> *17* You have heard, O YHWH, the desire of the humble; \\
You will strengthen their hearts. \\
You will incline Your ear,  \\
<<10:18>> *18* to vindicate the fatherless and oppressed, \\
that the men of the earth \\
may strike terror no more.  \\
* Psalm 11

[[html-class:drop][11]]

<<11:1>> In YHWH I take refuge.\\  
How then can you say to me: “Flee like a bird to your mountain!\\  
<<11:2>> *2* For behold, the wicked bend their bows.\\  
They set their arrow on the string\\  
to shoot from the shadows at the upright in heart.\\  
<<11:3>> *3* If the foundations are destroyed,\\  
what can the righteous do?”\\  
<<11:4>> *4* YHWH is in His holy temple;\\  
YHWH is on His heavenly throne.\\  
His eyes are watching closely;\\  
they examine the sons of men.\\  
<<11:5>> *5* YHWH tests the righteous and the wicked;\\  
His soul hates the lover of violence.\\  
<<11:6>> *6* On the wicked He will rain down fiery coals and sulfur;\\  
a scorching wind will be their portion.\\  
<<11:7>> *7* For YHWH is righteous; He loves justice.\\  
The upright will see His face.\\  

* Psalm 12
[[html-class:drop][12]]

<<12:1>> Help, O YHWH, for the godly are no more; \\
the faithful have vanished from among men. \\
<<12:2>> *2* They lie to one another; \\
they speak with flattering lips and a double heart. \\
<<12:3>> *3* May YHWH cut off all flattering lips \\
and every boastful tongue. \\
<<12:4>> *4* They say, “With our tongues we will prevail. \\
We own our lips—who can be our master?” \\
<<12:5>> *5* “For the cause of the oppressed \\
and for the groaning of the needy, \\
I will now arise,” says YHWH. \\
“I will bring safety to him who yearns.” \\
<<12:6>> *6* The words of YHWH are flawless, \\
like silver refined in a furnace, \\
like gold purified sevenfold. \\
<<12:7>> *7* You, O YHWH, will keep us; \\
You will forever guard us from this generation. \\
<<12:8>> *8* The wicked wander freely, \\
and vileness is exalted among men. \\
* Psalm 13

[[html-class:drop][13]]

<<13:1>> How long, O YHWH? \\
Will You forget me forever? \\
How long will You hide Your face from me? \\
<<13:2>> *2* How long must I wrestle in my soul, \\
with sorrow in my heart each day? \\
How long will my enemy dominate me? \\
<<13:3>> *3* Consider me and respond, O YHWH my God. \\
Give light to my eyes, lest I sleep in death, \\
<<13:4>> *4* lest my enemy say, “I have overcome him,” \\
and my foes rejoice when I fall. \\
<<13:5>> *5* But I have trusted in Your loving devotion; \\
my heart will rejoice in Your salvation. \\
<<13:6>> *6* I will sing to YHWH, \\
for He has been good to me. \\



* Psalm 14

[[html-class:drop][14]]

<<14:1>> The fool says in his heart, “There is no God.” \\
They are corrupt; their acts are vile. \\
There is no one who does good. \\
<<14:2>> *2* YHWH looks down from heaven \\
upon the sons of men \\
to see if any understand, \\
if any seek God. \\
<<14:3>> *3* All have turned away, \\
they have together become corrupt; \\
there is no one who does good, \\
not even one. \\
<<14:4>> *4* Will the workers of iniquity never learn? \\
They devour my people like bread; \\
they refuse to call upon YHWH. \\
<<14:5>> *5* There they are, overwhelmed with dread, \\
for God is in the company of the righteous. \\
<<14:6>> *6* You sinners frustrate the plans of the oppressed, \\
yet YHWH is their shelter. \\
<<14:7>> *7* Oh, that the salvation of Israel would come from Zion! \\
When YHWH restores His captive people, \\
let Jacob rejoice, let Israel be glad! \\

* Psalm 15

[[html-class:drop][15]]
<<15:1>> O YHWH, who may abide in Your tent? \\
Who may dwell on Your holy mountain? \\
<<15:2>> *2* He who walks with integrity \\
and practices righteousness, \\
who speaks the truth from his heart, \\
<<15:3>> *3* who has no slander on his tongue, \\
who does no harm to his neighbor, \\
who casts no scorn on his friend, \\
<<15:4>> *4* who despises the vile \\
but honors those who fear YHWH, \\
who does not revise a costly oath, \\
<<15:5>> *5* who lends his money without interest \\
and refuses a bribe against the innocent. \\
He who does these things \\
will never be shaken. \\

* Psalm 16

[[html-class:drop][16]]

<<16:1>> Preserve me, O God, \\
for in You I take refuge. \\
<<16:2>> *2* I said to YHWH, “You are my Lord; \\
apart from You I have no good thing.” \\
<<16:3>> *3* As for the saints in the land, \\
they are the excellence \\
in whom all my delight resides. \\

<<16:4>> *4* Sorrows will multiply \\
to those who chase other gods. \\
I will not pour out their libations of blood, \\
or speak their names with my lips. \\
<<16:5>> *5* YHWH is my chosen portion and my cup; \\
You have made my lot secure. \\
<<16:6>> *6* The lines of my boundary have fallen in pleasant places; \\
surely my inheritance is delightful. \\

<16:7>> *7* I will bless YHWH who counsels me; \\
even at night my conscience instructs me. \\
<<16:8>> *8* I have set YHWH always before me. \\
Because He is at my right hand, I will not be shaken. \\
<<16:9>> *9* Therefore my heart is glad and my tongue rejoices; \\
my body also will dwell securely. \\

<<16:10>> *10* For You will not abandon my soul to Sheol, \\
nor will You let Your Holy One see decay. \\
<<16:11>> *11* You have made known to me the path of life; \\
You will fill me with joy in Your presence, \\
with eternal pleasures at Your right hand. \\

* Psalm 17

[[html-class:drop][17]]
<<17:1>> Hear, O YHWH, my righteous plea; \\
listen to my cry. \\
Give ear to my prayer—it comes from lips free of deceit. \\
<<17:2>> *2* May my vindication come from Your presence; \\
may Your eyes see what is right. \\
<<17:3>> *3* You have tried my heart; \\
You have visited me in the night. \\
You have tested me and found no evil; \\
I have resolved not to sin with my mouth. \\
<<17:4>> *4* As for the deeds of men—by the word of Your lips \\
I have avoided the ways of the violent. \\
<<17:5>> *5* My steps have held to Your paths; \\
my feet have not slipped. \\
<<17:6>> *6* I call on You, O God, \\
for You will answer me. \\
Incline Your ear to me; \\
hear my words. \\
<<17:7>> *7* Show the wonders of Your loving devotion, \\
You who save by Your right hand \\
those who seek refuge from their foes. \\
<<17:8>> *8* Keep me as the apple of Your eye; \\
hide me in the shadow of Your wings \\
<<17:9>> *9* from the wicked who assail me, \\
from my mortal enemies who surround me. \\
<<17:10>> *10* They have closed their callous hearts; \\
their mouths speak with arrogance. \\
<<17:11>> *11* They have tracked us down, and now surround us; \\
their eyes are set to cast us to the ground, \\
<<17:12>> *12* like a lion greedy for prey, \\
like a young lion lurking in ambush. \\
<<17:13>> *13* Arise, O YHWH, confront them! \\
Bring them to their knees; \\
deliver me from the wicked by Your sword, \\
<<17:14>> *14* from such men, O YHWH, by Your hand— \\
from men of the world whose portion is in this life. \\
May You fill the bellies of Your treasured ones \\
and satisfy their sons, \\
so they leave their abundance to their children. \\
<<17:15>> *15* As for me, I will behold Your face in righteousness; \\
when I awake, I will be satisfied in Your presence. \\

* Psalm 18

[[html-class:drop][18]]
<<18:1>> I love You, O YHWH, my strength. \\
<<18:2>> *2* YHWH is my rock, my fortress, and my deliverer. \\
My God is my rock, in whom I take refuge, \\
my shield, and the horn of my salvation, \\
my stronghold. \\
<<18:3>> *3* I will call upon YHWH, who is worthy to be praised; \\
so shall I be saved from my enemies. \\
<<18:4>> *4* The cords of death encompassed me; \\
the torrents of chaos overwhelmed me. \\
<<18:5>> *5* The cords of Sheol entangled me; \\
the snares of death confronted me. \\
<<18:6>> *6* In my distress I called upon YHWH; \\
I cried to my God for help. \\
From His temple He heard my voice, \\
and my cry for His help reached His ears. \\
<<18:7>> Then the earth shook and quaked, \\
and the foundations of the mountains trembled; \\
they were shaken because He burned with anger. \\
<<18:8>> *8* Smoke rose from His nostrils, \\
and consuming fire came from His mouth; \\
glowing coals blazed forth. \\
<<18:9>> *9* He parted the heavens and came down \\
with dark clouds beneath His feet. \\
<<18:10>> *10* He mounted a cherub and flew; \\
He soared on the wings of the wind. \\
<<18:11>> *11* He made darkness His hiding place, \\
and storm clouds a canopy around Him. \\
<<18:12>> *12* From the brightness of His presence \\
His clouds advanced—hailstones and coals of fire. \\
<<18:13>> *13* YHWH thundered from heaven; \\
the voice of the Most High resounded—hailstones and coals of fire. \\
<<18:14>> *14* He shot His arrows and scattered the foes; \\
He hurled lightning and routed them. \\
<<18:15>> *15* The channels of the sea appeared, \\
and the foundations of the world were exposed, \\
at Your rebuke, O YHWH, \\
at the blast of the breath of Your nostrils. \\
<<18:16>> *16* He reached down from on high and took hold of me; \\
He drew me out of deep waters. \\
<<18:17>> *17* He rescued me from my powerful enemy, \\
from foes too mighty for me. \\
<<18:18>> *18* They confronted me in my day of calamity, \\
but YHWH was my support. \\
<<18:19>> *19* He brought me out into the open; \\
He rescued me because He delighted in me. \\
<<18:20>> *20* YHWH has rewarded me according to my righteousness; \\
He has repaid me according to the cleanness of my hands. \\

<<18:21>> *21* For I have kept the ways of YHWH \\
and have not wickedly departed from my God. \\
<<18:22>> *22* For all His ordinances are before me; \\
I have not disregarded His statutes. \\
<<18:23>> And I have been blameless before Him \\
and kept myself from iniquity. \\
<<18:24>> So YHWH has repaid me according to my righteousness, \\
according to the cleanness of my hands in His sight. \\
<<18:25>> To the faithful You show Yourself faithful, \\
to the blameless You show Yourself blameless; \\
<<18:26>> to the pure You show Yourself pure, \\
but to the crooked You show Yourself shrewd. \\
<<18:27>> For You save an afflicted people, \\
but You humble those with haughty eyes. \\
<<18:28>> For You, O YHWH, light my lamp; \\
my God lights up my darkness. \\
<<18:29>> For in You I can charge an army, \\
and with my God I can scale a wall. \\
<<18:30>> As for God, His way is perfect; \\
the word of YHWH is flawless. \\
He is a shield to all who take refuge in Him. \\
<<18:31>> For who is God besides YHWH? \\
And who is the Rock except our God? \\
<<18:32>> It is God who arms me with strength \\
and makes my way clear. \\
<<18:33>> He makes my feet like those of a deer \\
and stations me upon the heights. \\
<<18:34>> He trains my hands for battle; \\
my arms can bend a bow of bronze. \\
<<18:35>> You have given me Your shield of salvation; \\
Your right hand upholds me, \\
and Your gentleness exalts me. \\
<<18:36>> You broaden the path beneath me \\
so that my ankles do not give way. \\
<<18:37>> I pursued my enemies and overtook them; \\
I did not turn back until they were consumed. \\
<<18:38>> I crushed them so they could not rise; \\
they have fallen under my feet. \\
<<18:39>> You have armed me with strength for battle; \\
You have subdued my foes beneath me. \\
<<18:40>> You have made my enemies retreat before me; \\
I put an end to those who hated me. \\
<<18:41>> They cried for help, but there was no one to save them— \\
to YHWH, but He did not answer. \\
<<18:42>> I ground them as dust in the face of the wind; \\
I trampled them like mud in the streets. \\
<<18:43>> You have delivered me from the strife of the people; \\
You have made me the head of nations; \\
a people I had not known shall serve me. \\
<<18:44>> When they hear me, they obey me; \\
foreigners cower before me. \\
<<18:45>> Foreigners lose heart \\
and come trembling from their strongholds. \\
<<18:46>> YHWH lives, and blessed be my Rock! \\
And may the God of my salvation be exalted— \\
<<18:47>> the God who avenges me \\
and subdues nations beneath me, \\
<<18:48>> who delivers me from my enemies. \\
You exalt me above my foes; \\
You rescue me from violent men. \\
<<18:49>> Therefore I will praise You, O YHWH, among the nations; \\
I will sing praises to Your name. \\
<<18:50>> Great salvation He brings to His king. \\
He shows loving devotion to His anointed, \\
to David and his descendants forever. \\

<<19:1>> The heavens declare the glory of God; \\
the skies proclaim the work of His hands. \\
<<19:2>> *2* Day after day they pour forth speech; \\
night after night they reveal knowledge. \\
<<19:3>> *3* Without speech or language, \\
without a sound to be heard, \\
<<19:4>> *4* their voice has gone out into all the earth, \\
their words to the ends of the world. \\
In the heavens He has pitched a tent for the sun. \\
<<19:5>> *5* Like a bridegroom emerging from his chamber, \\
like a champion rejoicing to run his course, \\
<<19:6>> *6* it rises at one end of the heavens \\
and runs its circuit to the other; \\
nothing is deprived of its warmth. \\
<<19:7>> *7* The Law of YHWH is perfect, \\
reviving the soul; \\
the testimony of YHWH is trustworthy, \\
making wise the simple. \\
<<19:8>> *8* The precepts of YHWH are right, \\
bringing joy to the heart; \\
the commandments of YHWH are radiant, \\
giving light to the eyes. \\
<<19:9>> *9* The fear of YHWH is pure, \\
enduring forever; \\
the judgments of YHWH are true, \\
being altogether righteous. \\
<<19:10>> *10* They are more precious than gold, \\
than much pure gold; \\
they are sweeter than honey, \\
than honey from the comb. \\
<<19:11>> *11* By them indeed Your servant is warned; \\
in keeping them is great reward. \\
<<19:12>> *12* Who can discern his own errors? \\
Cleanse me from my hidden faults. \\
<<19:13>> *13* Keep Your servant also from willful sins; \\
may they not rule over me. \\
Then I will be blameless \\
and cleansed of great transgression. \\
<<19:14>> *14* May the words of my mouth \\
and the meditation of my heart \\
be pleasing in Your sight, \\
O YHWH, my Rock and my Redeemer. \\

May YHWH grant all your petitions. \\
<<20:6>> *6* Now I know that YHWH saves His anointed; \\
He answers him from His holy heaven \\
with the saving power of His right hand. \\
<<20:7>> *7* Some trust in chariots and others in horses, \\
but we trust in the name of YHWH our God. \\
<<20:8>> *8* They collapse and fall, \\
but we rise up and stand firm. \\
<<20:9>> *9* O YHWH, save the king. \\
Answer us on the day we call. \\

How greatly he exults in Your salvation! \\
<<21:2>> *2* You have granted his heart’s desire \\
and have not withheld the request of his lips. \\
Selah \\
<<21:3>> *3* For You welcomed him with rich blessings; \\
You placed on his head a crown of pure gold. \\
<<21:4>> *4* He asked You for life, and You granted it— \\
length of days, forever and ever. \\
<<21:5>> *5* Great is his glory in Your salvation; \\
You bestow on him splendor and majesty. \\
<<21:6>> *6* For You grant him blessings forever; \\
You cheer him with joy in Your presence. \\
<<21:7>> *7* For the king trusts in YHWH; \\
through the loving devotion of the Most High, \\
he will not be shaken. \\
<<21:8>> *8* Your hand will apprehend all Your enemies; \\
Your right hand will seize those who hate You. \\
<<21:9>> *9* You will place them in a fiery furnace \\
at the time of Your appearing. \\
In His wrath YHWH will engulf them, \\
and the fire will consume them. \\
<<21:10>> *10* You will wipe their descendants from the earth \\
and their offspring from the sons of men. \\
<<21:11>> *11* Though they intend You harm, \\
the schemes they devise will not prevail. \\
<<21:12>> *12* For You will put them to flight \\
when Your bow is trained upon them. \\
<<21:13>> *13* Be exalted, O YHWH, in Your strength; \\
we will sing and praise Your power. \\
* Psalm 22

[[html-class:drop][22]]
<<22:1>> My God, my God, \\
why have You forsaken me? \\
Why are You so far from saving me, \\
so far from my words of groaning? \\
<<22:2>> *2* I cry out by day, O my God, \\
but You do not answer, \\
and by night, but I have no rest. \\
<<22:3>> *3* Yet You are holy, \\
enthroned on the praises of Israel. \\
<<22:4>> *4* In You our fathers trusted; \\
they trusted and You delivered them. \\
<<22:5>> *5* They cried out to You and were set free; \\
they trusted in You and were not disappointed. \\
<<22:6>> *6* But I am a worm and not a man, \\
scorned by men and despised by the people. \\
<<22:7>> *7* All who see me mock me; \\
they sneer and shake their heads: \\
<<22:8>> *8* “He trusts in YHWH, \\
let YHWH deliver him; \\
let YHWH rescue him, \\
since He delights in him.” \\
<<22:9>> *9* Yet You brought me forth from the womb; \\
You made me secure at my mother’s breast. \\
<<22:10>> *10* From birth I was cast upon You; \\
from my mother’s womb You have been my God. \\
<<22:11>> *11* Be not far from me, \\
for trouble is near \\
and there is no one to help. \\
<<22:12>> *12* Many bulls surround me; \\
strong bulls of Bashan encircle me. \\
<<22:13>> *13* They open their jaws against me \\
like lions that roar and maul. \\
<<22:14>> *14* I am poured out like water, \\
and all my bones are disjointed. \\
My heart is like wax; \\
it melts away within me. \\
<<22:15>> *15* My strength is dried up like a potsherd, \\
and my tongue sticks to the roof of my mouth. \\
You lay me in the dust of death. \\
<<22:16>> *16* For dogs surround me; \\
a band of evil men encircles me; \\
they have pierced my hands and feet. \\
<<22:17>> *17* I can count all my bones; \\
they stare and gloat over me. \\
<<22:18>> *18* They divide my garments among them \\
and cast lots for my clothing. \\
<<22:19>> *19* But You, O YHWH, be not far off; \\
O my Strength, come quickly to help me. \\
<<22:20>> *20* Deliver my soul from the sword, \\
my precious life from the power of wild dogs. \\
<<22:21>> *21* Save me from the mouth of the lion; \\
at the horns of the wild oxen \\
You have answered me! \\
<<22:22>> *22* I will proclaim Your name to my brothers; \\
I will praise You in the assembly. \\
<<22:23>> *23* You who fear YHWH, praise Him! \\
All descendants of Jacob, honor Him! \\
All offspring of Israel, revere Him! \\
<<22:24>> *24* For He has not despised or detested \\
the torment of the afflicted. \\
He has not hidden His face from him, \\
but has attended to his cry for help. \\
<<22:25>> *25* My praise for You resounds in the great assembly; \\
I will fulfill my vows before those who fear You. \\
<<22:26>> *26* The poor will eat and be satisfied; \\
those who seek YHWH will praise Him. \\
May your hearts live forever! \\
<<22:27>> *27* All the ends of the earth \\
will remember and turn to YHWH. \\
All the families of the nations \\
will bow down before Him. \\
<<22:28>> *28* For dominion belongs to YHWH \\
and He rules over the nations. \\
<<22:29>> *29* All the rich of the earth will feast and worship; \\
all who go down to the dust will kneel before Him— \\
even those unable to preserve their lives. \\
<<22:30>> *30* Posterity will serve Him; \\
they will declare the Lord to a new generation. \\
<<22:31>> *31* They will come and proclaim His righteousness \\
to a people yet unborn— \\
all that He has done. \\
* Psalm 23

He guides me in the paths of righteousness \\
for the sake of His name. \\
<<23:4>> *4* Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of
death, \\
I will fear no evil, \\
for You are with me; \\
Your rod and Your staff, they comfort me. \\
<<23:5>> *5* You prepare a table before me \\
in the presence of my enemies. \\
You anoint my head with oil; \\
my cup overflows. \\
<<23:6>> *6* Surely goodness and mercy will follow me \\
all the days of my life, \\
and I will dwell in the house of YHWH \\
forever. \\

<<24:3>> *3* Who may ascend the hill of YHWH? \\
Who may stand in His holy place? \\
<<24:4>> *4* He who has clean hands and a pure heart, \\
who does not lift up his soul to an idol \\
or swear deceitfully. \\
<<24:5>> *5* He will receive blessing from YHWH \\
and vindication from the God of his salvation. \\

who seek Your face, O God of Jacob. \\
Selah \\

YHWH mighty in battle. \\

YHWH of Hosts—He is the King of Glory. \\

because of Your goodness, O YHWH. \\
<<25:8>> *8* Good and upright is YHWH; \\
therefore He shows sinners the way. \\
<<25:9>> *9* He guides the humble in what is right \\

forgive my iniquity, for it is great. \\

He will instruct him in the path chosen for him. \\

my enemies and foes stumbled and fell. \\

this is what I desire: \\
to dwell in the house of YHWH \\
all the days of my life, \\
to gaze on the beauty of YHWH \\
and seek Him in His temple. \\
<<27:5>> *5* For in the day of trouble \\
He will hide me in His shelter; \\
He will conceal me under the cover of His tent; \\
He will set me high upon a rock. \\
<<27:6>> *6* Then my head will be held high \\
above my enemies around me. \\
At His tabernacle I will offer sacrifices with shouts of joy; \\
I will sing and make music to YHWH. \\

be merciful and answer me. \\
<<27:8>> *8* My heart said, “Seek His face.” \\

the goodness of YHWH \\
in the land of the living. \\

Repay them for what their hands have done; \\
bring back on them what they deserve. \\

Weeping may stay the night, \\

You made my mountain stand strong. \\
When You hid Your face,I was dismayed. \\

<<30:9>> *9* “What gain is there in my bloodshed, \\
in my descent to the Pit? \\
Will the dust praise You? \\
Will it proclaim Your faithfulness?” \\
<<30:10>> *10* Hear me, O YHWH, and have mercy; \\
O YHWH, be my helper.” \\
<<30:11>> *11* You turned my mourning into dancing; \\

You have known the anguish of my soul. \\
<<31:8>> *8* You have not delivered me to the enemy; \\
You have set my feet in the open. \\
<<31:9>> *9* Be merciful to me, O YHWH, \\
for I am in distress; \\
my eyes fail from sorrow, \\
my soul and body as well. \\

Let the wicked be put to shame; \\
let them lie silent in Sheol. \\
<<31:18>> *18* May lying lips be silenced— \\
lips that speak with arrogance against the righteous, \\
full of pride and contempt. \\
<<31:19>> *19* How great is Your goodness \\
which You have laid up for those who fear You, \\
which You have bestowed before the sons of men \\
on those who take refuge in You! \\
<<31:20>> *20* You hide them in the secret place of Your presence \\
from the schemes of men. \\
You conceal them in Your shelter \\
from accusing tongues. \\
<<31:21>> *21* Blessed be YHWH, \\
for He has shown me His loving devotion \\

<<32:4>> *4* For day and night \\
Your hand was heavy upon me; \\
my strength was drained \\
as in the summer heat. \\
Selah \\
<<32:5>> *5* Then I acknowledged my sin to You \\
and did not hide my iniquity. \\
I said, “I will confess my transgressions to YHWH,” \\
and You forgave the guilt of my sin. \\
Selah \\
<<32:6>> *6* Therefore let all the godly pray to You \\
while You may be found. \\
Surely when great waters rise, \\
they will not come near. \\
<<32:7>> *7* You are my hiding place. \\
You protect me from trouble; \\
You surround me with songs of deliverance. \\
Selah \\
<<32:8>> *8* I will instruct you and teach you the way you should go; \\
I will give you counsel and watch over you. \\
<<32:9>> *9* Do not be like the horse or mule, \\
which have no understanding; \\
they must be controlled with bit and bridle \\
to make them come to you. \\
<<32:10>> *10* Many are the sorrows of the wicked, \\
but loving devotion surrounds him who trusts in YHWH. \\
<<32:11>> *11* Be glad in YHWH and rejoice, O righteous ones; \\
shout for joy, all you upright in heart.
* Psalm 33

[[html-class:drop][33]]
<<33:1>> Rejoice in YHWH, O righteous ones; \\
it is fitting for the upright to praise Him. \\
<<33:2>> *2* Praise YHWH with the harp; \\
make music to Him with ten strings. \\
<<33:3>> *3* Sing to Him a new song; \\
play skillfully with a shout of joy. \\
<<33:4>> *4* For the word of YHWH is upright, \\
and all His work is trustworthy. \\
<<33:5>> *5* YHWH loves righteousness and justice; \\
the earth is full of His loving devotion. \\
<<33:6>> *6* By the word of YHWH the heavens were made, \\
and all the stars by the breath of His mouth. \\
<<33:7>> *7* He piles up the waters of the sea; \\
He puts the depths into storehouses. \\
<<33:8>> *8* Let all the earth fear YHWH; \\
let all the people of the world revere Him. \\
<<33:9>> *9* For He spoke, and it came to be; \\
He commanded, and it stood firm. \\
<<33:10>> *10* YHWH frustrates the plans of the nations; \\
He thwarts the devices of the peoples. \\
<<33:11>> *11* The counsel of YHWH stands forever, \\
the purposes of His heart to all generations. \\
<<33:12>> *12* Blessed is the nation whose God is YHWH, \\
the people He has chosen as His inheritance! \\
<<33:13>> *13* YHWH looks down from heaven; \\
He sees all the sons of men. \\
<<33:14>> *14* From His dwelling place He gazes on \\
all who inhabit the earth. \\
<<33:15>> *15* He shapes the hearts of each; \\
He considers all their works. \\
<<33:16>> *16* No king is saved by his vast army; \\
no warrior is delivered by his great strength. \\
<<33:17>> *17* A horse is a vain hope for salvation; \\
even its great strength cannot save. \\
<<33:18>> *18* Surely the eyes of YHWH are on those who fear Him, \\
on those whose hope is in His loving devotion \\
<<33:19>> *19* to deliver them from death \\
and keep them alive in famine. \\
<<33:20>> *20* Our soul waits for YHWH; \\
He is our help and our shield. \\
<<33:21>> *21* For our hearts rejoice in Him, \\
since we trust in His holy name. \\
<<33:22>> *22* May Your loving devotion rest on us, O YHWH, \\
as we put our hope in You.
* Psalm 34

[[html-class:drop][34]]
<<34:1>> I will bless YHWH at all times; \\
His praise will always be on my lips. \\
<<34:2>> *2* My soul boasts in YHWH; \\
let the oppressed hear and rejoice. \\
<<34:3>> *3* Magnify YHWH with me; \\
let us exalt His name together. \\

<<34:4>> *4* I sought YHWH, and He answered me; \\
He delivered me from all my fears. \\
<<34:5>> *5* Those who look to Him are radiant with joy; \\
their faces shall never be ashamed. \\
<<34:6>> *6* This poor man called out, and YHWH heard him; \\
He saved him from all his troubles. \\
<<34:7>> *7* The angel of YHWH encamps around those who fear Him, \\
and he delivers them. \\

<<34:8>> *8* Taste and see that YHWH is good; \\
blessed is the man who takes refuge in Him! \\
<<34:9>> *9* Fear YHWH, you His saints, \\
for those who fear Him lack nothing. \\
<<34:10>> *10* Young lions go lacking and hungry, \\
but those who seek YHWH lack no good thing. \\
<<34:11>> *11* Come, children, listen to me; \\
I will teach you the fear of YHWH. \\
<<34:12>> *12* Who is the man who delights in life, \\
who desires to see good days? \\
<<34:13>> *13* Keep your tongue from evil \\
and your lips from deceitful speech. \\
<<34:14>> *14* Turn away from evil and do good; \\
seek peace and pursue it. \\

<<34:15>> *15* The eyes of YHWH are on the righteous, \\
and His ears are inclined to their cry. \\
<<34:16>> *16* But the face of YHWH is against those who do evil, \\
to wipe out all memory of them from the earth. \\
<<34:17>> *17* The righteous cry out, and YHWH hears; \\
He delivers them from all their troubles. \\
<<34:18>> *18* YHWH is near to the brokenhearted; \\
He saves the contrite in spirit. \\
<<34:19>> *19* Many are the afflictions of the righteous, \\
but YHWH delivers him from them all. \\
<<34:20>> *20* He protects all his bones; \\
not one of them will be broken. \\
<<34:21>> *21* Evil will slay the wicked, \\
and the haters of the righteous will be condemned. \\
<<34:22>> *22* YHWH redeems His servants, \\
and none who take refuge in Him will be condemned.

* Psalm 35

[[html-class:drop][35]]
<<35:1>> Contend with my opponents, O YHWH; \\
fight against those who fight against me. \\
<<35:2>> *2* Take up Your shield and buckler; \\
arise and come to my aid. \\
<<35:3>> *3* Draw the spear and javelin against my pursuers; \\
say to my soul: “I am your salvation.” \\
<<35:4>> *4* May those who seek my life \\
be disgraced and put to shame; \\
may those who plan to harm me \\
be driven back and confounded. \\
<<35:5>> *5* May they be like chaff in the wind, \\
as the angel of YHWH drives them away. \\
<<35:6>> *6* May their path be dark and slick, \\
as the angel of YHWH pursues. \\
<<35:7>> *7* For without cause they laid their net for me; \\
without reason they dug a pit for my soul. \\
<<35:8>> *8* May ruin befall them by surprise; \\
may the net they hid ensnare them; \\
may they fall into the hazard they created. \\
<<35:9>> *9* Then my soul will rejoice in YHWHand \\
exult in His salvation. \\
<<35:10>> *10* All my bones will exclaim, \\
“Who is like You, O YHWH, \\
who delivers the afflicted from the aggressor, \\
the poor and needy from the robber?” \\
<<35:11>> *11* Hostile witnesses come forward; \\
they make charges I know nothing about. \\
<<35:12>> *12* They repay me evil for good, \\
to the bereavement of my soul. \\
<<35:13>> *13* Yet when they were ill, \\
I put on sackcloth; \\
I humbled myself with fasting, \\
but my prayers returned unanswered. \\
<<35:14>> *14* I paced about as for my friend or brother; \\
I was bowed down with grief, \\
like one mourning for his mother. \\
<<35:15>> *15* But when I stumbled, they assembled in glee; \\
they gathered together against me. \\
Assailants I did not know \\
slandered me without ceasing. \\
<<35:16>> *16* Like godless jesters at a feast, \\
they gnashed their teeth at me. \\
<<35:17>> *17* How long, O Lord, will You look on? \\
Rescue my soul from their ravages, \\
my precious life from these lions. \\
<<35:18>> *18* Then I will give You thanks in the great assembly; \\
I will praise You among many people. \\
<<35:19>> *19* Let not my enemies gloat over me without cause, \\
nor those who hate me without reason wink in malice. \\
<<35:20>> *20* For they do not speak peace, \\
but they devise deceitful schemes \\
against those who live quietly in the land. \\
<<35:21>> *21* They gape at me and say, \\
“Aha, aha! Our eyes have seen!” \\
<<35:22>> *22* O YHWH, You have seen it; be not silent. \\
O Lord, be not far from me. \\
<<35:23>> *23* Awake and rise to my defense, \\
to my cause, my God and my Lord! \\
<<35:24>> *24* Vindicate me by Your righteousness, O YHWH my God, \\
and do not let them gloat over me. \\
<<35:25>> *25* Let them not say in their hearts, \\
“Aha, just what we wanted!” \\
Let them not say, \\
“We have swallowed him up!” \\
<<35:26>> *26* May those who gloat in my distress \\
be ashamed and confounded; \\
may those who exalt themselves over me \\
be clothed in shame and reproach. \\
<<35:27>> *27* May those who favor my vindications \\
shout for joy and gladness; \\
may they always say, \\
“Exalted be YHWH \\
who delights in His servant’s well-being.” \\
<<35:28>> *28* Then my tongue will proclaim Your righteousness \\
and Your praises all day long. \\
* Psalm 36

[[html-class:drop][36]]
<<36:1>> *1* An oracle is in my heart\\
regarding the transgression of the wicked man:\\
There is no fear of God\\
before his eyes. \\
<<36:2>> *2* For his eyes are too full of conceitto\\
detect or hate his own sin. \\
<<36:3>> *3* The words of his mouth are wicked and deceitful;\\
he has ceased to be wise and well-doing. \\
<<36:4>> *4* Even on his bed he plots wickedness;\\
he sets himself on a path that is not good;\\
he fails to reject evil. \\
<<36:5>> *5* Your loving devotion, O YHWH, reaches to the heavens,\\
Your faithfulness to the clouds. \\
<<36:6>> *6* Your righteousness is like the highest mountains;\\
Your judgments are like the deepest sea.\\
O YHWH, You preserve man and beast. \\
<<36:7>> *7* How precious is Your loving devotion, O God,\\
that the children of men take refuge\\
in the shadow of Your wings! \\
<<36:8>> *8* They feast on the abundance of Your house,\\
and You give them drink from Your river of delights. \\
<<36:9>> *9* For with You is the fountain of life;\\
in Your light we see light. \\
<<36:10>> *10* Extend Your loving devotion to those who know You,\\
and Your righteousness to the upright in heart. \\
<<36:11>> *11* Let not the foot of the proud come against me,\\
nor the hand of the wicked drive me away. \\
<<36:12>> *12* There the evildoers lie fallen,\\
thrown down and unable to rise. \\
* Psalm 37

[[html-class:drop][37]]
<<37:1>> Do not fret over those who do evil; \\
do not envy those who do wrong.  \\
<<37:2>> *2* For they wither quickly like grass \\
and wilt like tender plants.  \\
<<37:3>> *3* Trust in YHWH and do good; \\
dwell in the land and cultivate faithfulness.  \\
<<37:4>> *4* Delight yourself in YHWH, \\
and He will give you the desires of your heart.  \\
<<37:5>> *5* Commit your way to YHWH; \\
trust in Him, and He will do it.  \\
<<37:6>> *6* He will bring forth your righteousness like the dawn, \\
your justice like the noonday sun.  \\
<<37:7>> *7* Be still before YHWH \\
and wait patiently for Him; \\
do not fret when men prosper in their ways, \\
when they carry out wicked schemes.  \\
<<37:8>> *8* Refrain from anger and abandon wrath; \\
do not fret—it can only bring harm.  \\
<<37:9>> *9* For the evildoers will be cut off, \\
but those who hope in YHWH will inherit the land.  \\
<<37:10>> *10* Yet a little while, and the wicked will be no more; \\
though you look for them, they will not be found.  \\
<<37:11>> *11* But the meek will inherit the land \\
and delight in abundant prosperity.  \\
<<37:12>> *12* The wicked scheme against the righteous \\
and gnash their teeth at them,   \\
<<37:13>> *13* but the Lord laughs, \\
seeing that their day is coming.  \\
<<37:14>> *14* The wicked have drawn the sword \\
and bent the bowto bring down the poor and needy, \\
to slay those whose ways are upright.  \\
<<37:15>> *15* But their swords will pierce their own hearts, \\
and their bows will be broken.  \\
<<37:16>> *16* Better is the little of the righteous \\
than the abundance of many who are wicked.  \\
<<37:17>> *17* For the arms of the wicked will be broken, \\
but YHWH upholds the righteous.  \\
<<37:18>> *18* YHWH knows the days of the blameless, \\
and their inheritance will last forever.  \\
<<37:19>> *19* In the time of evil they will not be ashamed, \\
and in the days of famine they will be satisfied.  \\
<<37:20>> *20* But the wicked and enemies of YHWH \\
will perish like the glory of the fields. \\
They will vanish; \\
like smoke they will fade away.  \\
<<37:21>> *21* The wicked borrow and do not repay, \\
but the righteous are gracious and giving.  \\
<<37:22>> *22* Surely those He blesses will inherit the land, \\
but the cursed will be destroyed.  \\
<<37:23>> *23* The steps of a man are ordered by YHWH \\
who takes delight in his journey.  \\
<<37:24>> *24* Though he falls, he will not be overwhelmed, \\
for YHWH is holding his hand.  \\
<<37:25>> *25* I once was young and now am old, \\
yet never have I seen the righteous abandoned \\
or their children begging for bread.  \\
<<37:26>> *26* They are ever generous and quick to lend, \\
and their children are a blessing.  \\
<<37:27>> *27* Turn away from evil and do good, \\
so that you will abide forever.  \\
<<37:28>> *28* For YHWH loves justice \\
and will not forsake His saints. \\
They are preserved forever, \\
but the offspring of the wicked will be cut off.  \\
<<37:29>> *29* The righteous will inherit the land \\
and dwell in it forever.  \\
<<37:30>> *30* The mouth of the righteous man utters wisdom, \\
and his tongue speaks justice.  \\
<<37:31>> *31* The law of his God is in his heart; \\
his steps do not falter.  \\
<<37:32>> *32* Though the wicked lie in wait for the righteous, \\
and seek to slay them,   \\
<<37:33>> *33* YHWH will not leave them in their power \\
or let them be condemned under judgment.  \\
<<37:34>> *34* Wait for YHWH and keep His way, \\
and He will raise you up to inherit the land. \\
When the wicked are cut off, \\
you will see it.  \\
<<37:35>> *35* I have seen a wicked, ruthless man \\
flourishing like a well-rooted native tree,   \\
<<37:36>> *36* yet he passed away and was no more; \\
though I searched, he could not be found.  \\
<<37:37>> *37* Consider the blameless and observe the upright, \\
for posterity awaits the man of peace.  \\
<<37:38>> *38* But the transgressors will all be destroyed; \\
the future of the wicked will be cut off.  \\
<<37:39>> *39* The salvation of the righteous is from YHWH; \\
He is their stronghold in time of trouble.  \\
<<37:40>> *40* YHWH helps and delivers them; \\
He rescues and saves them from the wicked, \\
because they take refuge in Him.  \\
* Psalm 38

[[html-class:drop][38]]
<<38:1>> O YHWH, do not rebuke me in Your anger\\
or discipline me in Your wrath. \\
<<38:2>> *2* For Your arrows have pierced me deeply,\\
and Your hand has pressed down on me. \\
<<38:3>> *3* There is no soundness in my body\\
because of Your anger;\\
there is no rest in my bones\\
because of my sin. \\
<<38:4>> *4* For my iniquities have overwhelmed me;\\
they are a burden too heavy to bear. \\
<<38:5>> *5* My wounds are foul and festering\\
because of my sinful folly. \\
<<38:6>> *6* I am bent and brought low;\\
all day long I go about mourning. \\
<<38:7>> *7* For my loins are full of burning pain,\\
and no soundness remains in my body. \\
<<38:8>> *8* I am numb and badly crushed;\\
I groan in anguish of heart. \\
<<38:9>> *9* O Lord, my every desire is before You;\\
my groaning is not hidden from You. \\
<<38:10>> *10* My heart pounds, my strength fails,\\
and even the light of my eyes has faded. \\
<<38:11>> *11* My beloved and friends shun my disease,\\
and my kinsmen stand at a distance. \\
<<38:12>> *12* Those who seek my life lay snares;\\
those who wish me harm speak destruction,\\
plotting deceit all day long. \\
<<38:13>> *13* But like a deaf man, I do not hear;\\
and like a mute man, I do not open my mouth. \\
<<38:14>> *14* I am like a man who cannot hear,\\
whose mouth offers no reply. \\
<<38:15>> *15* I wait for You, O YHWH;\\
You will answer, O Lord my God. \\
<<38:16>> *16* For I said, “Let them not gloat over me—\\
those who taunt me when my foot slips.” \\
<<38:17>> *17* For I am ready to fall,\\
and my pain is ever with me. \\
<<38:18>> *18* Yes, I confess my iniquity;\\
I am troubled by my sin. \\
<<38:19>> *19* Many are my enemies without cause,\\
and many hate me without reason. \\
<<38:20>> *20* Those who repay my good with evil\\
attack me for pursuing the good. \\
<<38:21>> *21* Do not forsake me, O YHWH;\\
be not far from me, O my God. \\
<<38:22>> *22* Come quickly to help me,\\
O Lord my Savior. \\
* Psalm 39

[[html-class:drop][39]]
<<39:1>> I said, “I will watch my ways\\
so that I will not sin with my tongue;\\
I will guard my mouth with a muzzle\\
as long as the wicked are present.” \\
<<39:2>> *2* I was speechless and still;\\
I remained silent, even from speaking good,\\
and my sorrow was stirred. \\
<<39:3>> *3* My heart grew hot within me;\\
as I mused, the fire burned. Then I spoke with my tongue: \\
<<39:4>> *4* “Show me, O YHWH, my end\\
and the measure of my days.\\
Let me know how fleeting my life is. \\
<<39:5>> *5* You, indeed, have made my days as handbreadths,\\
and my lifetime as nothing before You.\\
Truly each man at his best\\
exists as but a breath.” Selah \\
<<39:6>> *6* Surely every man goes about like a phantom;\\
surely he bustles in vain;\\
he heaps up riches\\
not knowing who will haul them away. \\
<<39:7>> *7* And now, O Lord, for what do I wait?\\
My hope is in You. \\
<<39:8>> *8* Deliver me from all my transgressions;\\
do not make me the reproach of fools. \\
<<39:9>> *9* I have become mute;\\
I do not open my mouth\\
because of what You have done. \\
<<39:10>> *10* Remove Your scourge from me;\\
I am perishing by the force of Your hand. \\
<<39:11>> *11* You discipline and correct a man for his iniquity,\\
consuming like a moth what he holds dear;\\
surely each man is but a vapor.” Selah \\
<<39:12>> *12* Hear my prayer, O YHWH,\\
and give ear to my cry for help;\\
do not be deaf to my weeping.\\
For I am a foreigner dwelling with You,\\
a stranger like all my fathers. \\
<<39:13>> *13* Turn Your gaze away from me,\\
that I may again be cheered\\
before I depart and am no more.” \\
* Psalm 40

[[html-class:drop][40]]
<<40:1>> I waited patiently for YHWH;\\
He inclined to me and heard my cry. \\
<<40:2>> *2* He lifted me up from the pit of despair,\\
out of the miry clay;\\
He set my feet upon a rock,\\
and made my footsteps firm. \\
<<40:3>> *3* He put a new song in my mouth,\\
a hymn of praise to our God.\\
Many will see and fear\\
and put their trust in YHWH. \\
<<40:4>> *4* Blessed is the man\\
who has made YHWH his trust,\\
who has not turned to the proud,\\
nor to those who lapse into falsehood. \\
<<40:5>> *5* Many, O YHWH my God,\\
are the wonders You have done,\\
and the plans You have for us—\\
none can compare to You—\\
if I proclaim and declare them,\\
they are more than I can count. \\
<<40:6>> *6* Sacrifice and offering You did not desire,\\
but my ears You have opened.\\
Burnt offerings and sin offerings\\
You did not require. \\
<<40:7>> *7* Then I said, “Here I am, I have come—\\
it is written about me in the scroll: \\
<<40:8>> *8* I delight to do Your will, O my God;\\
Your law is within my heart.” \\
<<40:9>> *9* I proclaim righteousness in the great assembly;\\
behold, I do not seal my lips,\\
as You, O YHWH, do know. \\
<<40:10>> *10* I have not covered up Your righteousness in my heart;\\
I have declared Your faithfulness and salvation;\\
I have not concealed Your loving devotion and faithfulness\\
from the great assembly. \\
<<40:11>> *11* O YHWH, do not withhold Your mercy from me;\\
Your loving devotion and faithfulness will always guard me. \\
<<40:12>> *12* For evils without number surround me;\\
my sins have overtaken me,\\
so that I cannot see.\\
They are more than the hairs of my head,\\
and my heart has failed within me. \\
<<40:13>> *13* Be pleased, O YHWH, to deliver me;\\
hurry, O YHWH, to help me. \\
<<40:14>> *14* May those who seek my life\\
be ashamed and confounded;\\
may those who wish me harm\\
be repelled and humiliated. \\
<<40:15>> *15* May those who say to me, “Aha, aha!”\\
be appalled at their own shame. \\
<<40:16>> *16* May all who seek You\\
rejoice and be glad in You;\\
may those who love Your salvation\\
always say, “YHWH be magnified!” \\

may the Lord think of me.\\
You are my helper and deliverer;\\
O my God, do not delay. \\

<<41:3>> *3* YHWH will sustain him on his bed of illness\\
and restore him from his bed of sickness. \\
<<41:4>> *4* I said, “O YHWH, be gracious to me;\\
heal me, for I have sinned against You.” \\
<<41:5>> *5* My enemies say with malice: \\
“When will he die and be forgotten?” \\
<<41:6>> *6* My visitor speaks falsehood;\\
he gathers slander in his heart;\\
he goes out and spreads it abroad. \\
<<41:7>> *7* All who hate me whisper against me;\\
they imagine the worst for me: \\
<<41:8>> *8* “A vile disease has been poured into him;\\
he will never get up from where he lies!” \\
<<41:9>> *9* Even my close friend whom I trusted,\\
the one who shared my bread,\\
has lifted up his heel against me. \\
<<41:10>> *10* But You, O YHWH, be gracious to me and raise me up,\\
that I may repay them. \\
<<41:11>> *11* By this I know that You delight in me,\\
for my enemy does not triumph over me. \\
<<41:12>> *12* In my integrity You uphold me\\

“Where is your God?” \\

Why the unease within me?\\
Put your hope in God, for I will yet praise Him\\

Therefore I remember You\\

all Your breakers and waves\\

“Why have You forgotten me?\\
Why must I walk in sorrow\\

You crushed the peoples\\
and cast them out. \\

their arm did not bring them victory.\\
It was by Your right hand,Your arm, and the light of Your face,\\

<<44:4>> *4* You are my King, O God,\\
who ordains victories for Jacob. \\

Youor betrayed Your covenant. \\
<<44:18>> *18* Our hearts have not turned back;our steps have not
strayed from Your path. \\

[[html-class:drop][49]]
<<49:1>> Hear this, all you peoples; \\
listen, all inhabitants of the world,   \\
<<49:2>> *2* both low and high, \\
rich and poor alike.   \\
<<49:3>> *3* My mouth will impart wisdom, \\
and the meditation of my heart will bring understanding.   \\
<<49:4>> *4* I will incline my ear to a proverb; \\
I will express my riddle with the harp:   \\
<<49:5>> *5* Why should I fear in times of trouble, \\
when wicked usurpers surround me?   \\
<<49:6>> *6* They trust in their wealth \\
and boast in their great riches.   \\
<<49:7>> *7* No man can possibly redeem his brother \\
or pay his ransom to God.   \\
<<49:8>> *8* For the redemption of his soul is costly, \\
and never can payment suffice,   \\
<<49:9>> *9* that he should live on foreverand not see decay.   \\
<<49:10>> *10* For it is clear that wise men die, \\
and the foolish and the senseless both perish
and leave their wealth to others.   \\
<<49:11>> *11* Their graves are their eternal homes— \\
their dwellings for endless generations— \\
even though their lands were their namesakes.   \\
<<49:12>> *12* But a man, despite his wealth, cannot endure; \\
he is like the beasts that perish.   \\
<<49:13>> *13* This is the fate of the self-confident \\
and their followers who endorse their sayings. \\

Selah   \\

<<49:14>> *14* Like sheep they are destined for Sheol. \\
Death will be their shepherd. \\
The upright will rule them in the morning, \\
and their form will decay in Sheol, \\
far from their lofty abode.   \\
<<49:15>> *15* /But God will redeem my life from Sheol/, \\
/for He will surely take me to Himself/. \\

Selah   \\

<<49:16>> *16* Do not be amazed when a man grows rich, \\
when the splendor of his house increases.   \\
<<49:17>> *17* For when he dies, he will carry nothing away; \\
his abundance will not follow him down.   \\
<<49:18>> *18* Though in his lifetime he blesses his soul— \\
and men praise you when you prosper—   \\
<<49:19>> *19* he will join the generation of his fathers, \\
who will never see the light of day.   \\
<<49:20>> *20* A man who has riches without understanding \\
is like the beasts that perish.  \\

Consuming fire precedes Him,\\

O Israel, and I will testify against you:I am God, your God. \\

<<50:9>> *9* I have no need for a bull from your stall\\
or goats from your pens,\\
<<50:10>> *10* for every beast of the forest is Mine—\\
the cattle on a thousand hills.\\
<<50:11>> *11* I know every bird in the mountains,\\
and the creatures of the field are Mine. \\
<<50:12>> *12* If I were hungry, I would not tell you,\\
for the world is Mine, and the fullness thereof. \\

<<50:14>> *14* Sacrifice a thank offering to God,\\
and fulfill your vows to the Most High.\\
<<50:15>> *15* Call upon Me in the day of trouble;\\
I will deliver you, and you will honor Me.” \\
<<50:16>> *16* To the wicked, however, God says,“What right have you to
recite My statutes\\
and to bear My covenant on your lips?\\
<<50:17>> *17* For you hate My instruction\\
and cast My words behind you.\\
<<50:18>> *18* When you see a thief, you befriend him,\\
and throw in your lot with adulterers.\\
<<50:19>> *19* You unleash your mouth for evil\\
and unharness your tongue for deceit.\\
<<50:20>> *20* You sit and malign your brother;\\
you slander your own mother’s son.\\
<<50:21>> *21* You have done these things, and I kept silent;\\
you thought I was just like you.\\
But now I rebuke you\\
and accuse you to your face. \\
<<50:22>> *22* Now consider this, you who forget God,\\
lest I tear you to pieces, with no one to rescue you: \\
<<50:23>> *23* He who sacrifices a thank offering honors Me,\\
and to him who rights his way, I will show the salvation of God.”

<<58:6>> *6* O God, shatter their teeth in their mouths; \\
O YHWH, tear \\
out the fangs of the lions. \\
<<58:7>> *7* May they vanish \\
like water that runs off; \\
when they draw \\
the bow, \\
may their arrows be blunted. \\
<<58:8>> *8* Like a slug that dissolves in its slime, \\
like a woman’s \\
stillborn child, \\
may they never see the sun. \\
<<58:9>> *9* Before your pots can feel the burning thorns— \\
whether green or dry— \\
He will sweep them away. \\
<<58:10>> *10* The righteous will rejoice \\
when they see they are avenged; \\
they will wash their feet \\
in the blood of the wicked. \\
<<58:11>> *11* Then men will say,“There is surely a reward for the \\
righteous! \\
There is surely a God who judges the earth!” \\

Fierce men conspire \\

they move swiftly to attack me. \\
Arise to help me, \\

<<59:5>> *5* O YHWH God of Hosts, \\
the God of Israel, \\
rouse Yourself to punish all the nations; \\
show no mercy to the wicked traitors. \\
Selah \\
<<59:6>> *6* They return in the evening, snarling like dogs \\

<<59:7>> *7* See what they spew from their mouths— \\
sharp words from their lips: \\
“For who can hear us?” \\
<<59:8>> *8* But You, O YHWH, laugh at them; \\
You scoff at all the nations. \\
<<59:9>> *9* I will keep watch for You, O my strength, \\
because You, O God, are my fortress. \\
<<59:10>> *10* My God of loving devotion will come to meet me; \\
God will let me \\
stare down my foes. \\
<<59:11>> *11* Do not kill them, \\
or my people will forget. \\
Scatter them by Your power, \\
and bring them down, O Lord, our shield. \\
<<59:12>> *12* By the sins of their mouths \\
and the words of their lips, \\
let them be trapped in their pride, \\
in the curses and lies they utter. \\
<<59:13>> *13* Consume them in wrath; \\
consume them till they are no more, \\
so it may be known to the ends of the earth \\
that God rules over Jacob. \\
Selah \\
<<59:14>> *14* They return in the evening, \\
snarling like dogs \\
and prowling around the city. \\
<<59:15>> *15* They scavenge for food, \\
and growl if they are not satisfied. \\
<<59:16>> *16* But I will sing of Your strength \\
and proclaim Your loving devotion in the morning. \\
For You are my fortress, \\
my refuge in times of trouble. \\
<<59:17>> *17* To You, O my strength, I sing praises, \\
for You, O God, are my fortress, \\
my God of loving devotion. \\

when You marched through the wasteland, \\
Selah \\

<<68:9>> *9* You sent abundant rain, O God; \\
You refreshed Your weary inheritance. \\
<<68:10>> *10* Your flock settled therein; \\
O God, from Your bounty You provided for the poor. \\

she who waits at home divides the plunder.” \\
<<68:13>> *13* Though you lie down among the sheepfolds, \\
the wings of the dove are covered with silver, \\

This is the mountain God chose for His dwelling, \\

Scatter the nations who delight in war. \\

Cush will stretch out her hands to God. \\

behold, His mighty voice resounds. \\
<<68:34>> *34* Ascribe the power to God, \\
whose majesty is over Israel, \\

where there is no footing; \\
I have drifted into deep waters, \\
where the flood engulfs me. \\
<<69:3>> *3* I am weary from my crying; \\
my throat is parched. \\
My eyes fail, looking for my God. \\
<<69:4>> *4* Those who hate me without cause \\
outnumber the hairs of my head; \\
many are those who would destroy me— \\
my enemies for no reason. \\
Though I did not steal, \\
I must repay. \\
<<69:5>> *5* You know my folly, O God, \\
and my guilt is not hidden from You. \\
<<69:6>> *6* May those who hope in You not be ashamed through me, \\
O Lord GOD of Hosts; \\
may those who seek You not be dishonored through me, \\
O God of Israel. \\
<<69:7>> *7* For I have endured scorn for Your sake, \\
and shame has covered my face. \\
<<69:8>> *8* I have become a stranger to my brothers \\
and a foreigner to my mother’s sons, \\
<<69:9>> *9* because zeal for Your house has consumed me, \\
and the insults of those who insult You have fallen on me. \\
<<69:10>> *10* I wept and fasted, \\
but it brought me reproach. \\
<<69:11>> *11* I made sackcloth my clothing, \\
and I was sport to them. \\
<<69:12>> *12* Those who sit at the gate mock me, \\
and I am the song of drunkards. \\
<<69:13>> *13* But my prayer to You, O YHWH, \\
is for a time of favor. \\
In Your abundant loving devotion, O God, \\
answer me with Your sure salvation. \\
<<69:14>> *14* Rescue me from the mire \\
and do not let me sink; \\
deliver me from my foes \\
and out of the deep waters. \\
<<69:15>> *15* Do not let the floods engulf me \\
or the depths swallow me up; \\
let not the Pit close its mouth over me. \\
<<69:16>> *16* Answer me, O YHWH, \\
for Your loving devotion is good; \\
turn to me in keeping with Your great compassion. \\
<<69:17>> *17* Hide not Your face from Your servant, \\
for I am in distress. \\
Answer me quickly! \\
<<69:18>> *18* Draw near to my soul and redeem me; \\
ransom me because of my foes. \\
<<69:19>> *19* You know my reproach, my shame and disgrace. \\
All my adversaries are before You. \\
<<69:20>> *20* Insults have broken my heart, \\
and I am in despair. \\
I looked for sympathy, but there was none, \\
for comforters, but I found no one. \\
<<69:21>> *21* They poisoned my food with gall \\
and gave me vinegar to quench my thirst. \\
<<69:22>> *22* May their table become a snare; \\
may it be a retribution and a trap. \\
<<69:23>> *23* May their eyes be darkened so they cannot see, \\
and their backs be bent forever. \\
<<69:24>> *24* Pour out Your wrath upon them, \\
and let Your burning anger overtake them. \\
<<69:25>> *25* May their place be deserted; \\
let there be no one to dwell in their tents. \\
<<69:26>> *26* For they persecute the one You struck \\
and recount the pain of those You wounded. \\
<<69:27>> *27* Add iniquity to their iniquity; \\
let them not share in Your righteousness. \\
<<69:28>> *28* May they be blotted out of the Book of Life \\
and not listed with the righteous. \\
<<69:29>> *29* But I am in pain and distress; \\
let Your salvation protect me, O God. \\
<<69:30>> *30* I will praise God’s name in song \\
and exalt Him with thanksgiving. \\
<<69:31>> *31* And this will please YHWH more than an ox, \\
more than a bull with horns and hooves. \\
<<69:32>> *32* The humble will see and rejoice. \\
You who seek God, let your hearts be revived! \\
<<69:33>> *33* For YHWH listens to the needy \\
and does not despise His captive people. \\
<<69:34>> *34* Let heaven and earth praise Him, \\
the seas and everything that moves in them. \\
<<69:35>> *35* For God will save Zion \\
and rebuild the cities of Judah, \\
that they may dwell there and possess it. \\
<<69:36>> *36* The descendants of His servants will inherit it, \\
and those who love His name will settle in it. \\

Hurry, O YHWH, to help me!   \\

retreat because of their shame.  \\

<<71:12>> *12* Be not far from me, O God. \\
Hurry, O my God, to help me. \\
<<71:13>> *13* May the accusers of my soul \\
be ashamed and consumed; \\
may those who seek my harm \\
be covered with scorn and disgrace. \\
<<71:14>> *14* But I will always hope \\
and will praise You more and more. \\
<<71:15>> *15* My mouth will declare Your righteousness \\
and Your salvation all day long, \\
though I cannot know their full measure. \\
<<71:16>> *16* I will enter in the strength of the Lord GOD; \\
I will proclaim Your righteousness—Yours alone. \\
<<71:17>> *17* O God, You have taught me from my youth, \\
and to this day I proclaim Your marvelous deeds. \\
<<71:18>> *18* Even when I am old and gray, \\
do not forsake me, O God, \\
until I proclaim Your power to the next generation, \\
Your might to all who are to come. \\
<<71:19>> *19* Your righteousness reaches to the heavens, O God, \\
You who have done great things. \\
Who, O God, is like You? \\
<<71:20>> *20* Though You have shown me many troubles and misfortunes,
\\
You will revive me once again. \\
Even from the depths of the earth \\
You will bring me back up. \\
<<71:21>> *21* You will increase my honor \\
and comfort me once again. \\
<<71:22>> *22* So I will praise You with the harp \\
for Your faithfulness, O my God; \\
I will sing praise to You with the lyre, \\
O Holy One of Israel. \\
<<71:23>> *23* When I sing praise to You \\
my lips will shout for joy, \\
along with my soul, which You have redeemed. \\
<<71:24>> *24* My tongue will indeed proclaim \\
Your righteousness all day long, \\
for those who seek my harm \\
are disgraced and confounded.
* Psalm 72

<<72:1>> *1* Endow the king with Your justice, O God, \\
and the son of the king with Your righteousness \\
<<72:2>> *2* May he judge Your people with righteousness \\
and Your afflicted with justice. \\
<<72:3>> *3* May the mountains bring peace to the people, \\

through all generations \\
<<72:6>> *6* May he be like rain that falls on freshly cut grass, \\
like spring showers that water the earth \\
<<72:7>> *7* May the righteous flourish in his days \\
and prosperity abound, \\
until the moon is no more. \\
<<72:8>> *8* May he rule from sea to sea, \\
and from the Euphrates to the ends of the earth \\
<<72:9>> *9* May the nomads bow before him, \\
and his enemies lick the dust \\
<<72:10>> *10* May the kings of Tarshish and distant shores bring
tribute; \\
may the kings of Sheba and Seba offer gifts \\
<<72:11>> *11* May all kings bow down to him \\
and all nations serve him. \\
<<72:12>> *12* For he will deliver the needy who cry out \\
and the afflicted who have no helper \\
<<72:13>> *13* He will take pity on the poor and needy \\
and save the lives of the oppressed \\
<<72:14>> *14* He will redeem them from oppression and violence, \\

<<72:15>> *15* Long may he live! \\
May gold from Sheba be given him. \\
May people ever pray for him; \\
may they bless him all day long \\
<<72:16>> *16* May there be an abundance of grain in the land; \\
may it sway atop the hills. \\
May its fruit trees flourish like the forests of Lebanon, \\
and its people like the grass of the field \\
<<72:17>> *17* May his name endure forever; \\
may his name continue as long as the sun shines. \\
In him may all nations be blessed; \\
may they call him blessed. \\
<<72:18>> *18* Blessed be YHWH God, the God of Israel, \\
who alone does marvelous deeds \\
<<72:19>> *19* And blessed be His glorious name forever; \\

Amen and amen. \\

<<73:1>> Surely God is good to Israel, \\
to those who are pure in heart. \\
<<73:2>> *2* But as for me, my feet had almost stumbled; \\
my steps had nearly slipped. \\
<<73:3>> *3* For I envied the arrogant \\
when I saw the prosperity of the wicked.  \\
<<73:4>> *4* They have no struggle in their death; \\
their bodies are well-fed. \\
<<73:5>> *5* They are free of the burdens others carry; \\
they are not afflicted like other men. \\
<<73:6>> *6* Therefore pride is their necklace; \\
a garment of violence covers them. \\
<<73:7>> *7* From their prosperity proceeds iniquity; \\
the imaginations of their hearts run wild. \\
<<73:8>> *8* They mock and speak with malice; \\
with arrogance they threaten oppression. \\
<<73:9>> *9* They set their mouths against the heavens, \\
and their tongues strut across the earth.  \\
<<73:10>> *10* So their people return to this place \\
and drink up waters in abundance. \\
<<73:11>> *11* The wicked say, “How can God know? \\
Does the Most High have knowledge?” \\
<<73:12>> *12* Behold, these are the wicked— \\
always carefree as they increase their wealth.  \\
<<73:13>> *13* Surely in vain I have kept my heart pure; \\
in innocence I have washed my hands. \\
<<73:14>> *14* For I am afflicted all day long \\
and punished every morning. \\
<<73:15>> *15* If I had said, “I will speak this way,” \\
then I would have betrayed Your children. \\
<<73:16>> *16* When I tried to understand all this, \\
it was troublesome in my sight \\
<<73:17>> *17* until I entered God’s sanctuary; \\
then I discerned their end.  \\
<<73:18>> *18* Surely You set them on slick ground; \\
You cast them down into ruin. \\
<<73:19>> *19* How suddenly they are laid waste, \\
completely swept away by terrors! \\
<<73:20>> *20* Like one waking from a dream, \\
so You, O Lord, awaken and despise their form.  \\
<<73:21>> *21* When my heart was grieved \\
and I was pierced within, \\
<<73:22>> *22* I was senseless and ignorant; \\
I was a brute beast before You.  \\
<<73:23>> *23* Yet I am always with You; \\
You hold my right hand. \\
<<73:24>> *24* You guide me with Your counsel, \\
and later receive me in glory. \\
<<73:25>> *25* Whom have I in heaven but You? \\
And on earth I desire no one besides You. \\
<<73:26>> *26* My flesh and my heart may fail, \\
but God is the strength of my heart \\
and my portion forever.  \\
<<73:27>> *27* Those far from You will surely perish; \\
You destroy all who are unfaithful to You. \\
<<73:28>> *28* But as for me, it is good to draw near to God. \\
I have made the Lord GOD my refuge, \\
that I may proclaim all Your works. \\

Mount Zion where You dwell. \\
<<74:3>> *3* Turn Your steps to the everlasting ruins, \\
to everything in the sanctuary the enemy has destroyed. \\
of Asaph. \\
<<74:4>> *4* Your foes have roared within Your meeting place; \\
they have unfurled their banners as signs, \\
<<74:5>> *5* like men wielding axes in a thicket of trees \\
<<74:6>> *6* and smashing all the carvings with hatchets and picks. \\
<<74:7>> *7* They have burned Your sanctuary to the ground; \\
they have defiled the dwelling place of Your Name. \\
of Asaph. \\
<<74:8>> *8* They said in their hearts,“We will crush them

They burned down every place \\

There is no longer any prophet. \\

Will the foe revile Your name forever? \\

Stretch it out to destroy them! \\
of Asaph. \\
<<74:12>> *12* Yet God is my King from ancient times, \\
working salvation on the earth. \\
<<74:13>> *13* You divided the sea by Your strength; \\
You smashed the heads of the dragons of the sea; \\
<<74:14>> *14* You crushed the heads of Leviathan; \\
You fed him to the creatures of the desert. \\
<<74:15>> *15* You broke open the fountain and the flood; \\
You dried up the ever-flowing rivers. \\
<<74:16>> *16* The day is Yours, and also the night; \\
You established the moon and the sun. \\
<<74:17>> *17* You set all the boundaries of the earth; \\
You made the summer and winter. \\
of Asaph. \\
<<74:18>> *18* Remember how the enemy has mocked You, O YHWH, \\
how a foolish people has spurned Your name. \\
<<74:19>> *19* Do not deliver the soul of Your dove to beasts; \\
do not forget the lives of Your afflicted forever. \\
<<74:20>> *20* Consider Your covenant, \\
for haunts of violence fill the dark places of the land. \\
<<74:21>> *21* Do not let the oppressed retreat in shame; \\
may the poor and needy praise Your name. \\
of Asaph. \\
<<74:22>> *22* Rise up, O God; defend Your cause! \\
Remember how the fool mocks You all day long. \\
<<74:23>> *23* Do not disregard the clamor of Your adversaries, \\
the uproar of Your enemies that ascends continually. \\

and to the wicked, ‘Do not lift up your horn. \\
<<75:5>> *5* Do not lift up your horn against heaven \\
or speak with an outstretched neck.’” \\
<<75:6>> *6* For exaltation comes neither from east nor west, \\
nor out of the desert, \\
<<75:7>> *7* but it is God who judges; \\
He brings down one and exalts another. \\
<<75:8>> *8* For a cup is in the hand of YHWH, \\
full of foaming wine mixed with spices. \\
He pours from His cup, \\
and all the wicked of the earth \\
drink it down to the dregs. \\
<<75:9>> *9* But I will proclaim Him forever; \\
I will sing praise to the God of Jacob. \\

the shield and sword and weapons of war. \\
Selah \\
<<76:4>> *4* You are resplendent with light, \\
more majestic than mountains filled with game. \\
<<76:5>> *5* The valiant lie plundered; \\
they sleep their last sleep. \\
No men of might could lift a hand. \\
<<76:6>> *6* At Your rebuke, O God of Jacob, \\
both horse and rider lie stunned. \\
<<76:7>> *7* You alone are to be feared. \\
When You are angry, who can stand before You? \\

[[html-class:drop][77]]
<<77:1>> I cried out to God; \\
I cried aloud to God to hear me. \\
<<77:2>> *2* In the day of trouble I sought the Lord; \\
through the night my outstretched hands did not grow weary; \\
my soul refused to be comforted. \\
<<77:3>> *3* I remembered You, O God, and I groaned; \\
I mused and my spirit grew faint. \\
Selah \\
<<77:4>> *4* You have kept my eyes from closing; \\
I am too troubled to speak. \\
<<77:5>> *5* I considered the days of old, \\
the years long in the past. \\
<<77:6>> *6* At night I remembered my song; \\
in my heart I mused, and my spirit pondered: \\
<<77:7>> *7* “Will the Lord spurn us forever \\
and never show His favor again? \\
<<77:8>> *8* Is His loving devotion gone forever? \\
Has His promise failed for all time? \\
<<77:9>> *9* Has God forgotten to be gracious? \\
Has His anger shut off His compassion?” \\
Selah \\
<<77:10>> *10* So I said, “I am grieved \\
that the right hand of the Most High has changed.” \\
<<77:11>> *11* I will remember the works of YHWH; \\
yes, I will remember Your wonders of old. \\
<<77:12>> *12* I will reflect on all You have done \\
and ponder Your mighty deeds. \\
<<77:13>> *13* Your way, O God, is holy. \\
What god is so great as our God? \\
<<77:14>> *14* You are the God who works wonders; \\
You display Your strength among the peoples. \\
<<77:15>> *15* With power You redeemed Your people, \\
the sons of Jacob and Joseph. \\
Selah \\
<<77:16>> *16* The waters saw You, O God; \\
the waters saw You and swirled; \\
even the depths were shaken. \\
<<77:17>> *17* The clouds poured down water; \\
the skies resounded with thunder; \\
Your arrows flashed back and forth. \\
<<77:18>> *18* Your thunder resounded in the whirlwind; \\
the lightning lit up the world; \\
the earth trembled and quaked. \\
<<77:19>> *19* Your path led through the sea, \\
Your way through the mighty waters, \\
but Your footprints were not to be found. \\
<<77:20>> *20* You led Your people like a flock \\
by the hand of Moses and Aaron. \\
* Psalm 78

[[html-class:drop][78]]
<<78:1>> *1* Give ear, O my people, to my instruction; \\
listen to my words. \\
<<78:2>> *2* I will open my mouth in parables; \\
I will utter things hidden from the beginning, \\
<<78:3>> *3* that we have heard and known \\
and our fathers have relayed to us. \\
<<78:4>> *4* We will not hide them from their children, \\
but will declare to the next generation \\
the praises of YHWH and His might, \\
and the wonders He has performed. \\
<<78:5>> *5* For He established a testimony in Jacob \\
and appointed a law in Israel, \\
which He commanded our fathers \\
to teach to their children, \\
<<78:6>> *6* that the coming generation would know them—even children
yet to be born—to arise and tell their own children \\
<<78:7>> *7* that they should put their confidence in God, \\
not forgetting His works, \\
but keeping His commandments. \\
<<78:8>> *8* Then they will not be like their fathers, \\
a stubborn and rebellious generation, \\
whose heart was not loyal, \\
whose spirit was not faithful to God. \\
<<78:9>> *9* The archers of Ephraim \\
turned back on the day of battle. \\
<<78:10>> *10* They failed to keep God’s covenant \\
and refused to live by His law. \\
<<78:11>> *11* They forgot what He had done, \\
the wonders He had shown them. \\
<<78:12>> *12* He worked wonders before their fathers \\
in the land of Egypt, in the region of Zoan. \\
<<78:13>> *13* He split the sea and brought them through; \\
He set the waters upright like a wall. \\
<<78:14>> *14* He led them with a cloud by day \\
and with a light of fire all night. \\
<<78:15>> *15* He split the rocks in the wilderness \\
and gave them drink as abundant as the seas. \\
<<78:16>> *16* He brought streams from the stone \\
and made water flow down like rivers. \\
<<78:17>> *17* But they continued to sin against Him, \\
rebelling in the desert against the Most High. \\
<<78:18>> *18* They willfully tested God \\
by demanding the food they craved. \\
<<78:19>> *19* They spoke against God, saying, “Can God really
prepare a table in the wilderness? \\
<<78:20>> *20* When He struck the rock, water gushed out \\
and torrents raged. But can He also give bread \\
or supply His people with meat?” \\
<<78:21>> *21* Therefore YHWH heard \\
and was filled with wrath; \\
so a fire was kindled against Jacob, \\
and His anger flared against Israel, \\
<<78:22>> *22* because they did not believe God \\
or rely on His salvation. \\
<<78:23>> *23* Yet He commanded the clouds above \\
and opened the doors of the heavens. \\
<<78:24>> *24* He rained down manna for them to eat; \\
He gave them grain from heaven. \\
<<78:25>> *25* Man ate the bread of angels; \\
He sent them food in abundance. \\
<<78:26>> *26* He stirred the east wind from the heavens \\
and drove the south wind by His might. \\
<<78:27>> *27* He rained meat on them like dust, \\
and winged birds like the sand of the sea. \\
<<78:28>> *28* He felled them in the midst of their camp, \\
all around their dwellings. \\
<<78:29>> *29* So they ate and were well filled, \\
for He gave them what they craved. \\
<<78:30>> *30* Yet before they had filled their desire, \\
with the food still in their mouths, \\
<<78:31>> *31* God’s anger flared against them, \\
and He put to death their strongest \\
and subdued the young men of Israel. \\
<<78:32>> *32* In spite of all this, they kept on sinning; \\
despite His wonderful works, they did not believe. \\
<<78:33>> *33* So He ended their days in futility, \\
and their years in sudden terror. \\
<<78:34>> *34* When He slew them, they sought Him; \\
they repented and searched for God. \\
<<78:35>> *35* And they remembered that God was their Rock, \\
that God Most High was their Redeemer. \\
<<78:36>> *36* But they deceived Him with their mouths, \\
and lied to Him with their tongues. \\
<<78:37>> *37* Their hearts were disloyal to Him, \\
and they were unfaithful to His covenant. \\
<<78:38>> *38* And yet He was compassionate; \\
He forgave their iniquity and did not destroy them. \\
He often restrained His anger \\
and did not unleash His full wrath. \\
<<78:39>> *39* He remembered that they were but flesh, \\
a passing breeze that does not return. \\
<<78:40>> *40* How often they disobeyed Him in the wilderness \\
and grieved Him in the desert! \\
<<78:41>> *41* Again and again they tested God \\
and provoked the Holy One of Israel. \\
<<78:42>> *42* They did not remember His power— \\
the day He redeemed them from the adversary, \\
<<78:43>> *43* when He performed His signs in Egypt \\
and His wonders in the fields of Zoan. \\
<<78:44>> *44* He turned their rivers to blood, \\
and from their streams they could not drink. \\
<<78:45>> *45* He sent swarms of flies that devoured them, \\
and frogs that devastated them. \\
<<78:46>> *46* He gave their crops to the grasshopper, \\
the fruit of their labor to the locust. \\
<<78:47>> *47* He killed their vines with hailstones \\
and their sycamore-figs with sleet. \\
<<78:48>> *48* He abandoned their cattle to the hail \\
and their livestock to bolts of lightning. \\
<<78:49>> *49* He unleashed His fury against them, \\
wrath, indignation, and calamity— \\
a band of destroying angels. \\
<<78:50>> *50* He cleared a path for His anger; \\
He did not spare them from death \\
but delivered their lives to the plague. \\
<<78:51>> *51* He struck all the firstborn of Egypt, \\
the virility in the tents of Ham. \\
<<78:52>> *52* He led out His people like sheep \\
and guided them like a flock in the wilderness. \\
<<78:53>> *53* He led them safely, so they did not fear, \\
but the sea engulfed their enemies. \\
<<78:54>> *54* He brought them to His holy land, \\
to the mountain His right hand had acquired. \\
<<78:55>> *55* He drove out nations before them \\
and apportioned their inheritance; \\
He settled the tribes of Israel in their tents. \\
<<78:56>> *56* But they tested and disobeyed God Most High, \\
for they did not keep His decrees. \\
<<78:57>> *57* They turned back and were faithless like their
fathers, \\
twisted like a faulty bow. \\
<<78:58>> *58* They enraged Him with their high places \\
and provoked His jealousy with their idols. \\
<<78:59>> *59* On hearing it, God was furious \\
and rejected Israel completely. \\
<<78:60>> *60* He abandoned the tabernacle of Shiloh, \\
the tent He had pitched among men. \\
<<78:61>> *61* He delivered His strength to captivity, \\
and His splendor to the hand of the adversary. \\
<<78:62>> *62* He surrendered His people to the sword \\
because He was enraged by His heritage. \\
<<78:63>> *63* Fire consumed His young men, \\
and their maidens were left without wedding songs. \\
<<78:64>> *64* His priests fell by the sword, \\
but their widows could not lament. \\
<<78:65>> *65* Then the Lord awoke as from sleep, \\
like a mighty warrior overcome by wine. \\
<<78:66>> *66* He beat back His foes; \\
He put them to everlasting shame. \\
<<78:67>> *67* He rejected the tent of Joseph \\
and refused the tribe of Ephraim. \\
<<78:68>> *68* But He chose the tribe of Judah, \\
Mount Zion, which He loved. \\
<<78:69>> *69* He built His sanctuary like the heights, \\
like the earth He has established forever. \\
<<78:70>> *70* He chose David His servant \\
and took him from the sheepfolds; \\
<<78:71>> *71* from tending the ewes He brought him \\
to be shepherd of His people Jacob, \\
of Israel His inheritance.
* Psalm 79

<<79:1>> *1* The nations, O God, have invaded Your inheritance; \\

the flesh of Your saints to the beasts of the earth. \\
<<79:3>> *3* They have poured out their blood like water \\

Will Your jealousy burn like fire? \\

by the strength of Your arm preserve those condemned to death. \\

sevenfold the reproach they hurled at You, O Lord. \\

Look down from heaven and see! \\
Attend to this vine— \\
<<80:15>> *15* the root Your right hand has planted, \\
the son You have raised up for Yourself. \\

they perish at the rebuke of Your countenance. \\

on the son of man You have raised up for Yourself. \\
<<80:18>> *18* Then we will not turn away from You; \\
revive us, and we will call on Your name. \\

cause Your face to shine upon us, \\
that we may be saved. \\

play the sweet-sounding harp and lyre. \\
<<81:3>> *3* Sound the ram’s horn at the New Moon, \\
and at the full moon on the day of our Feast. \\
<<81:4>> *4* For this is a statute for Israel, \\
an ordinance of the God of Jacob. \\
<<81:5>> *5* He ordained it as a testimony for Joseph \\
when he went out over the land of Egypt, \\
where I heard an unfamiliar language: \\
<<81:6>> *6* “I relieved his shoulder of the burden; \\
his hands were freed from the basket. \\
<<81:7>> *7* You called out in distress, and I rescued you; \\
I answered you from the cloud of thunder; \\
I tested you at the waters of Meribah. \\
Selah \\
<<81:8>> *8* Hear, O My people, and I will warn you: \\
O Israel, if only you would listen to Me! \\
<<81:9>> *9* There must be no strange god among you, \\
nor shall you bow to a foreign god. \\
<<81:10>> *10* I am YHWH your God, \\
who brought you up out of Egypt. \\
Open wide your mouth, and I will fill it. \\
<<81:11>> *11* But My people would not listen to Me, \\
and Israel would not obey Me. \\
<<81:12>> *12* So I gave them up to their stubborn hearts \\
to follow their own devices. \\
<<81:13>> *13* If only My people would listen to Me, \\
if Israel would follow My ways, \\
<<81:14>> *14* how soon I would subdue their enemies \\
and turn My hand against their foes! \\
<<81:15>> *15* Those who hate YHWH would feign obedience, \\
and their doom would last forever. \\
<<81:16>> *16* But I would feed you the finest wheat; \\
with honey from the rock I would satisfy you.” \\

they wander in the darkness; \\
all the foundations of the earth are shaken. \\
<<82:6>> *6* I have said, ‘You are gods; \\
you are all sons of the Most High.’ \\
<<82:7>> *7* But like mortals you will die, \\

and conspire against those You cherish, \\
 \\
<<83:4>> *4* saying, “Come, let us erase them as a nation; \\
may the name of Israel be remembered no more.” \\
<<83:5>> *5* For with one mind they plot together, \\
they form an alliance against You— \\
 \\

of Moab and the Hagrites, \\
 \\
<<83:7>> *7* of Gebal, Ammon, and Amalek, \\
of Philistia with the people of Tyre. \\

lending strength to the sons of Lot. Selah \\

<<83:9>> *9* Do to them as You did to Midian, \\
as to Sisera and Jabin at the River Kishon, \\
 \\
<<83:10>> *10* who perished at Endor \\

 \\
<<83:11>> *11* Make their nobles like Oreb and Zeeb, \\
and all their princes like Zebah and Zalmunna, \\

<<83:12>> *12* who said, “Let us possess for ourselvesthe pastures of
God.” \\
<<83:13>> *13* Make them like tumbleweed, O my God, \\
like chaff before the wind.  \\
<<83:14>> *14* As fire consumes a forest, \\
as a flame sets the mountains ablaze, \\
 \\
<<83:15>> *15* so pursue them with Your tempest, \\
and terrify them with Your storm.  \\
<<83:16>> *16* Cover their faces with shame, \\
that they may seek Your name, O YHWH. \\
<<83:17>> *17* May they be ever ashamed and terrified; \\
may they perish in disgrace.  \\
<<83:18>> *18* May they know that You alone, \\
whose name is YHWH, are Most High over all the earth. \\

They are ever praising You. Selah \\

give ear, O God of Jacob. Selah \\

I would rather be a doorkeeper in the house of my God \\
than dwell in the tents of the wicked. \\
<<84:11>> *11* For YHWH God is a sun and a shield; \\
YHWH gives grace and glory; \\
He withholds no good thing \\

how blessed is the man who trusts in You! \\

Tabor and Hermon shout for joy at Your name. \\

I have exalted one chosen from the people. \\

my God, the Rock of my salvation.’ \\
<<89:27>> *27* I will indeed appoint him as My firstborn, \\
the highest of the kings of the earth. \\
<<89:28>> *28* I will forever preserve My loving devotion for him, \\
and My covenant with him will stand fast. \\
<<89:29>> *29* I will establish his line forever, \\
his throne as long as the heavens endure. \\
<<89:30>> *30* If his sons forsake My law \\
and do not walk in My judgments, \\
<<89:31>> *31* if they violate My statutes \\
and fail to keep My commandments, \\
<<89:32>> *32* I will attend to their transgression with the rod, \\
and to their iniquity with stripes. \\
<<89:33>> *33* But I will not withdraw My loving devotion from him, \\
nor ever betray My faithfulness. \\
<<89:34>> *34* I will not violate My covenant \\
or alter the utterance of My lips. \\
<<89:35>> *35* Once and for all I have sworn by My holiness— \\
I will not lie to David— \\
<<89:36>> *36* his offspring shall endure forever, \\
and his throne before Me like the sun, \\
<<89:37>> *37* like the moon, established forever, \\
a faithful witness in the sky.” Selah \\
<<89:38>> *38* Now, however, You have spurned and rejected him; \\
You are enraged by Your anointed one. \\
<<89:39>> *39* You have renounced the covenant with Your servant \\
and sullied his crown in the dust. \\
<<89:40>> *40* You have broken down all his walls; \\
You have reduced his strongholds to rubble. \\
<<89:41>> *41* All who pass by plunder him; \\
he has become a reproach to his neighbors. \\
<<89:42>> *42* You have exalted the right hand of his foes; \\
You have made all his enemies rejoice. \\
<<89:43>> *43* You have bent the edge of his sword \\
and have not sustained him in battle. \\
<<89:44>> *44* You have ended his splendor \\
and cast his throne to the ground. \\
<<89:45>> *45* You have cut short the days of his youth; \\
You have covered him with shame. Selah \\
<<89:46>> *46* How long, O YHWH? \\
Will You hide Yourself forever? \\
Will Your wrath keep burning like fire? \\
<<89:47>> *47* Remember the briefness of my lifespan! \\
For what futility You have created all men! \\
<<89:48>> *48* What man can live and never see death? \\
Can he deliver his soul from the power of Sheol? Selah \\
<<89:49>> *49* Where, O Lord, is Your loving devotion of old, \\
which You faithfully swore to David? \\
<<89:50>> *50* Remember, O Lord, the reproach of Your servants, \\
which I bear in my heart from so many people— \\
<<89:51>> *51* how Your enemies have taunted, O YHWH, \\

the mighty breakers of the sea— \\
YHWH on high is majestic. \\
<<93:5>> *5* Your testimonies are fully confirmed; \\
holiness adorns Your house, O YHWH, \\

* Psalm 94

[[html-class:drop][94]]
<<94:1>> O YHWH, God of vengeance, \\
O God of vengeance, shine forth. \\
<<94:2>> *2* Rise up, O Judge of the earth; \\
render a reward to the proud. \\
<<94:3>> *3* How long will the wicked, O YHWH, \\
how long will the wicked exult? \\
<<94:4>> *4* They pour out arrogant words; \\
all workers of iniquity boast. \\
<<94:5>> *5* They crush Your people, O YHWH; \\
they oppress Your heritage. \\
<<94:6>> *6* They kill the widow and the foreigner; \\
they murder the fatherless. \\
<<94:7>> *7* They say, “YHWH does not see; \\
the God of Jacob pays no heed.” \\
<<94:8>> *8* Take notice, O senseless among the people! \\
O fools, when will you be wise? \\
<<94:9>> *9* He who affixed the ear, can He not hear? \\
He who formed the eye, can He not see? \\
<<94:10>> *10* He who admonishes the nations, does He not discipline? \\
He who teaches man, does He lack knowledge? \\
<<94:11>> *11* YHWH knows the thoughts of man, \\
that they are futile. \\
<<94:12>> *12* Blessed is the man You discipline, O YHWH, \\
and teach from Your law, \\
<<94:13>> *13* to grant him relief from days of trouble, \\
until a pit is dug for the wicked. \\
<<94:14>> *14* For YHWH will not forsake His people; \\
He will never abandon His heritage. \\
<<94:15>> *15* Surely judgment will again be righteous, \\
and all the upright in heart will follow it. \\
<<94:16>> *16* Who will rise up for me against the wicked? \\
Who will stand for me against the workers of iniquity? \\
<<94:17>> *17* Unless YHWH had been my helper, \\
I would soon have dwelt in the abode of silence. \\
<<94:18>> *18* If I say, “My foot is slipping,” \\
Your loving devotion, O YHWH, supports me. \\
<<94:19>> *19* When anxiety overwhelms me, \\
Your consolation delights my soul. \\
<<94:20>> *20* Can a corrupt throne be Your ally— \\
one devising mischief by decree? \\
<<94:21>> *21* They band together against the righteous \\
and condemn the innocent to death. \\
<<94:22>> *22* But YHWH has been my stronghold, \\
and my God is my rock of refuge. \\
<<94:23>> *23* He will bring upon them their own iniquity \\
and destroy them for their wickedness. \\
YHWH our God will destroy them.

let us kneel before YHWH our Maker. \\
<<95:7>> *7* For He is our God, \\
and we are the people of His pasture, \\
the sheep under His care. Today, if you hear His voice, <<95:8>> *8*
do not harden your hearts \\
as you did at Meribah, \\
in the day at Massah in the wilderness, <<95:9>> *9* where your
fathers tested and tried Me, \\
though they had seen My work. <<95:10>> *10* For forty years I was
angry with that generation, \\
and I said, “They are a people whose hearts go astray, \\
and they have not known My ways.” <<95:11>> *11* So I swore on oath in
My anger, \\
“They shall never enter My rest.”

<<102:1>> Hear my prayer, O LORD; \\
let my cry for help come before You. \\
<<102:2>> Do not hide Your face from mein my day of distress. \\
Incline Your ear to me;answer me quickly when I call. \\
<<102:3>> For my days vanish like smoke, \\
and my bones burn like glowing embers. \\
<<102:4>> My heart is afflicted, and withered like grass; \\
I even forget to eat my bread. \\
<<102:5>> Through my loud groaning \\
my flesh clings to my bones. \\
<<102:6>> I am like a desert owl, \\
like an owl among the ruins. \\
<<102:7>> I lie awake; \\
I am like a lone bird on a housetop. \\
<<102:8>> All day long my enemies taunt me; \\
they ridicule me and curse me. \\
<<102:9>> For I have eaten ashes like bread \\
and mixed my drink with tears \\
<<102:10>> because of Your indignation and wrath, \\
for You have picked me up and cast me aside. \\
<<102:11>> My days are like lengthening shadows, \\
and I wither away like grass. \\
<<102:12>> But You, O LORD, sit enthroned forever; \\
Your renown endures to all generations. \\
<<102:13>> You will rise up and have compassion on Zion, \\
for it is time to show her favor—the appointed time has come. \\
<<102:14>> For Your servants delight in her stones \\
and take pity on her dust. \\
<<102:15>> So the nations will fear the name of the LORD, \\
and all the kings of the earth will fear Your glory. \\
<<102:16>> For the LORD will rebuild Zion; \\
He has appeared in His glory. \\
<<102:17>> He will turn toward the prayer of the destitute; \\
He will not despise their prayer. \\
<<102:18>> Let this be written for the generation to come, \\
so that a people not yet created may praise the LORD. \\
<<102:19>> For He looked down from the heights of His sanctuary; \\
the LORD gazed out from heaven to earth \\
<<102:20>> to hear a prisoner’s groaning, \\
to release those condemned to death, \\
<<102:21>> that they may proclaim the name of the LORD in Zion \\
and praise Him in Jerusalem, \\
<<102:22>> when peoples and kingdoms assemble \\
to serve the LORD. \\
<<102:23>> He has broken my strength on the way; \\
He has cut short my days. \\
<<102:24>> I say: “O my God, do not take me in the midst of my days!
\\
Your years go on through all generations. \\
<<102:25>> In the beginning You laid the foundations of the earth, \\
and the heavens are the work of Your hands. \\
<<102:26>> They will perish, but You remain; \\
they will all wear out like a garment. \\
Like clothing You will change them, \\
and they will be passed on. \\
<<102:27>> But You remain the same, \\
and Your years will never end. \\
<<102:28>> The children of Your servants will dwell securely, \\
and their descendants will be established before You.” \\

and crowns you with loving devotion and compassion, \\
<<103:5>> *5* who satisfies you with good things, \\

His deeds to the people of Israel. \\
<<103:8>> *8* YHWH is compassionate and gracious, \\
slow to anger, abounding in loving devotion. \\
<<103:9>> *9* He will not always accuse us, \\
nor harbor His anger forever. \\
<<103:10>> *10* He has not dealt with us according to our sins \\
or repaid us according to our iniquities. \\
<<103:11>> *11* For as high as the heavens are above the earth, \\
so great is His loving devotion for those who fear Him. \\
<<103:12>> *12* As far as the east is from the west, \\
so far has He removed our transgressions from us. \\
<<103:13>> *13* As a father has compassion on his children, \\
so YHWH has compassion on those who fear Him. \\
<<103:14>> *14* For He knows our frame; \\
He is mindful that we are dust. \\
<<103:15>> *15* As for man, his days are like grass— \\
he blooms like a flower of the field; \\
<<103:16>> *16* when the wind passes over, it vanishes, \\
and its place remembers it no more. \\
<<103:17>> *17* But from everlasting to everlasting \\
the loving devotion of YHWH \\
extends to those who fear Him, \\
and His righteousness to their children’s children— \\
<<103:18>> *18* to those who keep His covenant \\
and remember to obey His precepts. \\
<<103:19>> *19* YHWH has established His throne in heaven, \\

<<104:1>> Bless YHWH, O my soul! \\
O YHWH my God, You are very great; \\
You are clothed with splendor and majesty. \\
<<104:2>> *2* He wraps Himself in light as with a garment; \\
He stretches out the heavens like a tent, \\
<<104:3>> *3* laying the beams of His chambers \\
in the waters above, \\
making the clouds His chariot, \\
walking on the wings of the wind. \\
<<104:4>> *4* He makes the winds His messengers, \\
flames of fire His servants. \\
<<104:5>> *5* He set the earth on its foundations, \\
never to be moved. \\
<<104:6>> *6* You covered it with the deep like a garment; \\
the waters stood above the mountains. \\
<<104:7>> *7* At Your rebuke the waters fled; \\
at the sound of Your thunder they hurried away— \\
<<104:8>> *8* the mountains rose and the valleys sank \\
to the place You assigned for them— \\
<<104:9>> *9* You set a boundary they cannot cross, \\
that they may never again cover the earth. \\
<<104:10>> *10* He sends forth springs in the valleys; \\
they flow between the mountains. \\
<<104:11>> *11* They give drink to every beast of the field; \\
the wild donkeys quench their thirst. \\
<<104:12>> *12* The birds of the air nest beside the springs; \\
they sing among the branches. \\
<<104:13>> *13* He waters the mountains from His chambers; \\
the earth is satisfied by the fruit of His works. \\
<<104:14>> *14* He makes the grass grow for the livestock \\
and provides crops for man to cultivate, \\
bringing forth food from the earth: \\
<<104:15>> *15* wine that gladdens the heart of man, \\
oil that makes his face to shine, \\
and bread that sustains his heart. \\
<<104:16>> *16* The trees of YHWH have their fill, \\
the cedars of Lebanon that He planted, \\
<<104:17>> *17* where the birds build their nests; \\
the stork makes her home in the cypresses. \\
<<104:18>> *18* The high mountains are for the wild goats, \\
the cliffs a refuge for the rock badgers. \\
<<104:19>> *19* He made the moon to mark the seasons; \\
the sun knows when to set. \\
<<104:20>> *20* You bring darkness, and it becomes night, \\
when all the beasts of the forest prowl. \\
<<104:21>> *21* The young lions roar for their prey \\
and seek their food from God. \\
<<104:22>> *22* The sun rises, and they withdraw; \\
they lie down in their dens. \\
<<104:23>> *23* Man goes forth to his work \\
and to his labor until evening. \\
<<104:24>> *24* How many are Your works, O YHWH! \\
In wisdom You have made them all; \\
the earth is full of Your creatures. \\
<<104:25>> *25* Here is the sea, vast and wide, \\
teeming with creatures beyond number, \\
living things both great and small. \\
<<104:26>> *26* There the ships pass, \\
and Leviathan, which You formed to frolic there. \\
<<104:27>> *27* All creatures look to You \\
to give them their food in due season. \\
<<104:28>> *28* When You give it to them, \\
they gather it up; \\
when You open Your hand, \\
they are satisfied with good things. \\
<<104:29>> *29* When You hide Your face, \\
they are terrified; \\
when You take away their breath, \\
they die and return to dust.  \\
<<104:30>> *30* When You send Your Spirit, \\
they are created, \\
and You renewthe face of the earth.  \\
<<104:31>> *31* May the glory of YHWH endure forever; \\
may YHWH rejoice in His works.  \\
<<104:32>> *32* He looks on the earth, \\
and it trembles; \\
He touches the mountains, \\
and they smolder.  \\
<<104:33>> *33* I will sing to YHWH all my life; \\
I will sing praise to my God while I have my being.  \\
<<104:34>> *34* May my meditation be pleasing to Him, \\
for I rejoice in YHWH.  \\
<<104:35>> *35* May sinners vanish from the earth \\
and the wicked be no more. Bless YHWH, O my soul. Hallelujah!   \\

the word He ordained for a thousand generations— \\
<<105:9>> *9* the covenant He made with Abraham, \\
and the oath He swore to Isaac. \\
<<105:10>> *10* He confirmed it to Jacob as a decree, \\
to Israel as an everlasting covenant: \\
<<105:11>> *11* “I will give you the land of Canaanas the portion of
your inheritance.” \\
<<105:12>> *12* When they were few in number, \\
few indeed, and strangers in the land, \\
<<105:13>> *13* they wandered from nation to nation, \\
from one kingdom to another. \\
<<105:14>> *14* He let no man oppress them; \\
He rebuked kings on their behalf: \\
<<105:15>> *15* “Do not touch My anointed ones! \\
Do no harm to My prophets!” \\
<<105:16>> *16* He called down famine on the land \\
and cut off all their supplies of food. \\
<<105:17>> *17* He sent a man before them—Joseph, sold as a slave. \\
<<105:18>> *18* They bruised his feet with shackles \\
and placed his neck in irons, \\
<<105:19>> *19* until his prediction came true \\
and the word of YHWH proved him right. \\
<<105:20>> *20* The king sent and released him; \\
the ruler of peoples set him free. \\
<<105:21>> *21* He made him master of his household, \\
ruler over all his substance, \\
<<105:22>> *22* to instruct his princes as he pleased \\
and teach his elders wisdom. \\
<<105:23>> *23* Then Israel entered Egypt; \\
Jacob dwelt in the land of Ham. \\
<<105:24>> *24* And YHWH made His people very fruitful, \\
more numerous than their foes, \\
<<105:25>> *25* whose hearts He turned to hate His people, \\
to conspire against His servants. \\
<<105:26>> *26* He sent Moses His servant, \\
and Aaron, whom He had chosen. \\
<<105:27>> *27* They performed His miraculous signs among them, \\
and wonders in the land of Ham. \\
<<105:28>> *28* He sent darkness, and it became dark—yet they defied
His words. \\
<<105:29>> *29* He turned their waters to blood \\
and caused their fish to die. \\
<<105:30>> *30* Their land teemed with frogs, \\
even in their royal chambers. \\
<<105:31>> *31* He spoke, and insects swarmed—gnats throughout their
country. \\
<<105:32>> *32* He gave them hail for rain, \\
with lightning throughout their land. \\
<<105:33>> *33* He struck their vines and fig trees \\
and shattered the trees of their country. \\
<<105:34>> *34* He spoke, and the locusts came—young locusts without
number. \\
<<105:35>> *35* They devoured every plant in their land \\
and consumed the produce of their soil. \\
<<105:36>> *36* Then He struck all the firstborn in their land, \\
the firstfruits of all their vigor. \\
<<105:37>> *37* He brought Israel out with silver and gold, \\
and none among His tribes stumbled. \\
<<105:38>> *38* Egypt was glad when they departed, \\
for the dread of Israel had fallen on them. \\
<<105:39>> *39* He spread a cloud as a covering \\
and a fire to light up the night. \\
<<105:40>> *40* They asked, and He brought quailand satisfied them
with the bread of heaven. \\
<<105:41>> *41* He opened a rock, and water gushed out; \\
it flowed like a river in the desert. \\
<<105:42>> *42* For He remembered His holy promiseto Abraham His
servant. \\
<<105:43>> *43* He brought forth His people with rejoicing, \\
His chosen with shouts of joy. \\
<<105:44>> *44* He gave them the lands of the nations, \\

<<106:4>> Remember me, O YHWH, in Your favor to Your people; \\
visit me with Your salvation, \\
<<106:5>> that I may see the prosperity of Your chosen ones, \\
and rejoice in the gladness of Your nation, \\
and give glory with Your inheritance. \\
<<106:6>> We have sinned like our fathers; \\
we have done wrong and acted wickedly. \\
<<106:7>> Our fathers in Egypt did not grasp Your wonders \\
or remember Your abundant kindness; \\
but they rebelled by the sea, \\
there at the Red Sea. \\
<<106:8>> Yet He saved them for the sake of His name, \\
to make His power known. \\
<<106:9>> He rebuked the Red Sea, and it dried up; \\
He led them through the depths as through a desert. \\
<<106:10>> He saved them from the hand that hated them; \\
He redeemed them from the hand of the enemy. \\
<<106:11>> The waters covered their foes; \\
not one of them remained. \\
<<106:12>> Then they believed His promises \\
and sang His praise. \\
<<106:13>> Yet they soon forgot His works \\
and failed to wait for His counsel. \\
<<106:14>> They craved intensely in the wilderness \\
and tested God in the desert. \\
<<106:15>> So He granted their request, \\
but sent a wasting disease upon them. \\
<<106:16>> In the camp they envied Moses, \\
as well as Aaron, the holy one of YHWH. \\
<<106:17>> The earth opened up and swallowed Dathan; \\
it covered the assembly of Abiram. \\
<<106:18>> Then fire blazed through their company; \\
flames consumed the wicked. \\
<<106:19>> At Horeb they made a calf \\
and worshiped a molten image. \\
<<106:20>> They exchanged their Glory \\
for the image of a grass-eating ox. \\
<<106:21>> They forgot God their Savior, \\
who did great things in Egypt, \\
<<106:22>> wondrous works in the land of Ham, \\
and awesome deeds by the Red Sea. \\
<<106:23>> So He said He would destroy them— \\
had not Moses His chosen one \\
stood before Him in the breach \\
to divert His wrath from destroying them. \\
<<106:24>> They despised the pleasant land; \\
they did not believe His promise. \\
<<106:25>> They grumbled in their tents \\
and did not listen to the voice of YHWH. \\
<<106:26>> So He raised His hand and swore \\
to cast them down in the wilderness, \\
<<106:27>> to disperse their offspring among the nations \\
and scatter them throughout the lands. \\
<<106:28>> They yoked themselves to Baal of Peor \\
and ate sacrifices offered to lifeless gods. \\
<<106:29>> So they provoked YHWH to anger with their deeds, \\
and a plague broke out among them. \\
<<106:30>> But Phinehas stood and intervened, \\
and the plague was restrained. \\
<<106:31>> It was credited to him as righteousness \\
for endless generations to come. \\
<<106:32>> At the waters of Meribah they angered YHWH, \\
and trouble came to Moses because of them. \\
<<106:33>> For they rebelled against His Spirit, \\
and Moses spoke rashly with his lips. \\
<<106:34>> They did not destroy the peoples \\
as YHWH had commanded them, \\
<<106:35>> but they mingled with the nations \\
and adopted their customs. \\
<<106:36>> They worshiped their idols, \\
which became a snare to them. \\
<<106:37>> They sacrificed their sons \\
and their daughters to demons. \\
<<106:38>> They shed innocent blood— \\
the blood of their sons and daughters, \\
whom they sacrificed to the idols of Canaan, \\
and the land was polluted with blood. \\
<<106:39>> They defiled themselves by their actions \\
and prostituted themselves by their deeds. \\
<<106:40>> So the anger of YHWH burned against His people, \\
and He abhorred His own inheritance. \\
<<106:41>> He delivered them into the hand of the nations, \\
and those who hated them ruled over them. \\
<<106:42>> Their enemies oppressed them, \\
and subdued them under their hand. \\
<<106:43>> Many times He rescued them, \\
but they were bent on rebellion \\
and sank down in their iniquity. \\
<<106:44>> Nevertheless He heard their cry; \\
He took note of their distress. \\
<<106:45>> And He remembered His covenant with them, \\
and relented by the abundance of His loving devotion. \\
<<106:46>> He made them objects of compassion \\
to all who held them captive. \\
<<106:47>> Save us, O YHWH our God, \\
and gather us from the nations, \\
that we may give thanks to Your holy name, \\
that we may glory in Your praise. \\
<<106:48>> Blessed be YHWH, the God of Israel, \\
from everlasting to everlasting. \\
Let all the people say, “Amen!” Hallelujah! \\
* Psalm 107

[[html-class:drop][107]]
<<107:1>> Give thanks to YHWH, for He is good; \\
His loving devotion endures forever. \\
<<107:2>> Let the redeemed of YHWH say so, \\
whom He has redeemed from the hand of the enemy \\
<<107:3>> and gathered from the lands, \\
from east and west, from north and south. \\
<<107:4>> Some wandered in desert wastelands, \\
finding no path to a city in which to dwell. \\
<<107:5>> They were hungry and thirsty; \\
their soul fainted within them. \\
<<107:6>> Then they cried out to YHWH in their trouble, \\
and He delivered them from their distress. \\
<<107:7>> He led them on a straight path \\
to reach a city where they could live. \\
<<107:8>> Let them give thanks to YHWH for His loving devotion \\
and His wonders to the sons of men. \\
<<107:9>> For He satisfies the thirsty \\
and fills the hungry with good things. \\
<<107:10>> Some sat in darkness and in the shadow of death, \\
prisoners in affliction and chains, \\
<<107:11>> because they rebelled against the words of God \\
and despised the counsel of the Most High. \\
<<107:12>> He humbled their hearts with hard labor; \\
they stumbled, and there was no one to help. \\
<<107:13>> Then they cried out to YHWH in their trouble, \\
and He saved them from their distress. \\
<<107:14>> He brought them out of darkness and the shadow of death \\
and broke away their chains. \\
<<107:15>> Let them give thanks to YHWH for His loving devotion \\
and His wonders to the sons of men. \\
<<107:16>> For He has broken down the gates of bronze \\
and cut through the bars of iron. \\
<<107:17>> Fools, in their rebellious ways, \\
and through their iniquities, suffered affliction. \\
<<107:18>> They loathed all food \\
and drew near to the gates of death. \\
<<107:19>> Then they cried out to YHWH in their trouble, \\
and He saved them from their distress. \\
<<107:20>> He sent forth His word and healed them; \\
He rescued them from the Pit. \\
<<107:21>> Let them give thanks to YHWH for His loving devotion \\
and His wonders to the sons of men. \\
<<107:22>> Let them offer sacrifices of thanksgiving \\
and declare His works with rejoicing. \\
<<107:23>> Others went out to sea in ships, \\
conducting trade on the mighty waters. \\
<<107:24>> They saw the works of YHWH, \\
and His wonders in the deep. \\
<<107:25>> For He spoke and raised a tempest \\
that lifted the waves of the sea. \\
<<107:26>> They mounted up to the heavens, then sunk to the depths; \\
their courage melted in their anguish. \\
<<107:27>> They reeled and staggered like drunkards, \\
and all their skill was useless. \\
<<107:28>> Then they cried out to YHWH in their trouble, \\
and He brought them out of their distress. \\
<<107:29>> He calmed the storm to a whisper, \\
and the waves of the sea were hushed. \\
<<107:30>> They rejoiced in the silence, \\
and He guided them to the harbor they desired. \\
<<107:31>> Let them give thanks to YHWH for His loving devotion \\
and His wonders to the sons of men. \\
<<107:32>> Let them exalt Him in the assembly of the people \\
and praise Him in the council of the elders. \\
<<107:33>> He turns rivers into deserts, \\
springs of water into thirsty ground, \\
<<107:34>> and fruitful land into fields of salt, \\
because of the wickedness of its dwellers. \\
<<107:35>> He turns a desert into pools of water \\
and a dry land into flowing springs. \\
<<107:36>> He causes the hungry to settle there, \\
that they may establish a city in which to dwell. \\
<<107:37>> They sow fields and plant vineyards \\
that yield a fruitful harvest. \\
<<107:38>> He blesses them, and they multiply greatly; \\
He does not let their herds diminish. \\
<<107:39>> When they are decreased and humbled \\
by oppression, evil, and sorrow, \\
<<107:40>> He pours out contempt on the nobles \\
and makes them wander in a trackless wasteland. \\
<<107:41>> But He lifts the needy from affliction \\
and increases their families like flocks. \\
<<107:42>> The upright see and rejoice, \\
and all iniquity shuts its mouth. \\
<<107:43>> Let him who is wise pay heed to these things \\
and consider the loving devotion of YHWH. \\

Ephraim is My helmet, Judah is My scepter. \\
<<108:9>> Moab is My washbasin; \\
upon Edom I toss My sandal; \\
over Philistia I shout in triumph.” A song. \\
<<108:10>> Who will bring me to the fortified city? \\
Who will lead me to Edom? \\
<<108:11>> Have You not rejected us, O God? \\
Will You no longer march out, O God, with our armies? \\
<<108:12>> Give us aid against the enemy, \\
for the help of man is worthless. \\

and He will trample our enemies. \\
* Psalm 109

[[html-class:drop][109]]
<<109:1>> O God of my praise, \\
be not silent. \\
<<109:2>> For wicked and deceitful mouths open against me; \\
they speak against me with lying tongues. \\
<<109:3>> They surround me with hateful words \\
and attack me without cause. \\
<<109:4>> In return for my love they accuse me, \\
but I am a man of prayer. \\
<<109:5>> They repay me evil for good, \\
and hatred for my love. \\
<<109:6>> Set over him a wicked man; \\
let an accuser stand at his right hand. \\
<<109:7>> When he is tried, let him be found guilty, \\
and may his prayer be regarded as sin. \\
<<109:8>> May his days be few; \\
may another take his position. \\
<<109:9>> May his children be fatherless \\
and his wife a widow. \\
<<109:10>> May his children wander as beggars, \\
seeking sustenance far from their ruined homes. \\
<<109:11>> May the creditor seize all he owns, \\
and strangers plunder the fruits of his labor. \\
<<109:12>> May there be no one to extend kindness to him, \\
and no one to favor his fatherless children. \\
<<109:13>> May his descendants be cut off; \\
may their name be blotted out from the next generation. \\
<<109:14>> May the iniquity of his fathers be remembered before YHWH,
\\
and the sin of his mother never be blotted out. \\
<<109:15>> May their sins always remain before YHWH, \\
that He may cut off their memory from the earth. \\
<<109:16>> For he never thought to show kindness, \\
but pursued the poor and needy and brokenhearted, \\
even to their death. \\
<<109:17>> The cursing that he loved, may it fall on him; \\
the blessing in which he refused to delight, may it be far from him.
\\
<<109:18>> The cursing that he wore like a coat, may it soak into his
body like water, \\
and into his bones like oil. \\
<<109:19>> May it be like a robe wrapped about him, \\
like a belt tied forever around him. \\
<<109:20>> May this be YHWH’s reward to my accusers, \\
to those who speak evil against me. \\
<<109:21>> But You, O GOD, the Lord, \\
deal kindly with me for the sake of Your name; \\
deliver me by the goodness of Your loving devotion. \\
<<109:22>> For I am poor and needy; \\
my heart is wounded within me. \\
<<109:23>> I am fading away like a lengthening shadow; \\
I am shaken off like a locust. \\
<<109:24>> My knees are weak from fasting, \\
and my body grows lean and gaunt. \\
<<109:25>> I am an object of scorn to my accusers; \\
when they see me, they shake their heads. \\
<<109:26>> Help me, O YHWH my God; \\
save me according to Your loving devotion. \\
<<109:27>> Let them know that this is Your hand, \\
that You, O YHWH, have done it. \\
<<109:28>> Though they curse, You will bless. \\
When they rise up, they will be put to shame, \\
but Your servant will rejoice. \\
<<109:29>> May my accusers be clothed with disgrace; \\
may they wear their shame like a robe. \\
<<109:30>> With my mouth I will thank YHWH profusely; \\
I will praise Him in the presence of many. \\
<<109:31>> For He stands at the right hand of the needy one, \\
to save him from the condemners of his soul. \\

whose affairs are guided by justice. \\
<<112:6>> Surely he will never be shaken; \\
the righteous man will be remembered forever. \\
<<112:7>> He does not fear bad news; \\
his heart is steadfast, trusting in YHWH. \\
<<112:8>> His heart is assured; he does not fear, \\
until he looks in triumph on his foes. \\
<<112:9>> He has scattered abroad his gifts to the poor; \\
his righteousness endures forever; \\

<<118:12>> *12* They swarmed around me like bees, \\

but YHWH helped me.  \\

The right hand of YHWH performs with valor!”  \\
<<118:17>> *17* I will not die, but I will live \\
and proclaim what YHWH has done.  \\
<<118:18>> *18* YHWH disciplined me severely, \\
but He has not given me over to death.  \\
<<118:19>> *19* Open to me the gates of righteousness, \\
that I may enter and give thanks to YHWH.  \\
<<118:20>> *20* This is the gate of YHWH; \\
the righteous shall enter through it.  \\

<<127:2>> In vain you rise early and stay up late, \\
toiling for bread to eat—for He gives sleep to His beloved. \\
<<127:3>> Children are indeed a heritage from YHWH, \\
and the fruit of the womb is His reward. \\

He will not be put to shame when he confronts the enemies at the gate.

blessings and prosperity will be yours. \\

within your house, \\
your sons like olive shoots sitting around your table. \\
<<128:4>> In this way indeed shall blessing come to the man who
fears YHWH. \\
<<128:5>> May YHWH bless you from Zion, \\
that you may see the prosperity of Jerusalem all the days of your
life, \\

Israel now declare— \\

but they have not prevailed against me. \\
<<129:3>> The plowmen plowed over my back; \\
they made their furrows long. \\
<<129:4>> YHWH is righteous; He has cut me from the cords of the
wicked. \\
<<129:5>> May all who hate Zion be turned back in shame. \\
<<129:6>> May they be like grass on the rooftops, which withers

Lord, could stand? \\

feared. \\
<<130:5>> I wait for YHWH; my soul does wait, and in His word I
put my hope. \\

the morning—more than watchmen wait for the morning. \\

<<131:1>> My heart is not proud, O YHWH, my eyes are not
haughty. \\
I do not aspire to great things or matters too lofty for me. \\

like a weaned child with his mother, like a weaned child is my soul
within me. \\

* Psalm 132

[[html-class:drop][132]]
<<132:1>> O YHWH, remember on behalf of David \\
all the hardships he endured, \\
<<132:2>> how he swore an oath to YHWH, and vowed to the Mighty
One of Jacob: \\
<<132:3>> “I will not enter my house or get into my bed, \\
<<132:4>> I will not give sleep to my eyes or slumber to my
eyelids, \\
<<132:5>> until I find a place for YHWH, a dwelling for the
Mighty One of Jacob.” \\
<<132:6>> We heard that the ark was in Ephrathah; we found it in
the fields of Jaar. \\
<<132:7>> Let us go to His dwelling place; let us worship at His
footstool. \\
<<132:8>> Arise, O YHWH, to Your resting place, You and the ark
of Your strength. \\
<<132:9>> May Your priests be clothed with righteousness, and
Your saints shout for joy. \\
<<132:10>> For the sake of Your servant David, do not reject
Your anointed one. \\
<<132:11>> YHWH swore an oath to David, a promise He will not
revoke: “One of your descendants I will place on your throne. \\
<<132:12>> If your sons keep My covenant and the testimony I
will teach them, then their sons will also sit on your throne forever
and ever.” \\
<<132:13>> For YHWH has chosen Zion; He has desired it for His
home: \\
<<132:14>> “This is My resting place forever and ever; here I
will dwell, for I have desired this home. \\
<<132:15>> I will bless her with abundant provisions; I will
satisfy her poor with bread. \\
<<132:16>> I will clothe her priests with salvation, and her
saints will sing out in joy. \\
<<132:17>> There I will make a horn grow for David; I have
prepared a lamp for My anointed one. \\
<<132:18>> I will clothe his enemies with shame, but the crown
upon him will gleam.”
* Psalm 133

[[html-class:drop][133]]
<<133:1>> Behold, how good and pleasant it is\\
when brothers live together in harmony! \\

running down on the beard,\\
running down Aaron’s beard\\
over the collar of his robes. \\
<<133:3>> *3* It is like the dew of Hermon\\
falling on the mountains of Zion.\\
For there YHWH has bestowed the blessing\\
of life forevermore. \\

in the heavens and on the earth, \\

of both man and beast. \\
<<135:9>> *9* He sent signs and wonders into your midst, O Egypt, \\
against Pharaoh and all his servants. \\

Og king of Bashan, \\
and all the kings of Canaan. \\
<<135:12>> *12* He gave their land as an inheritance, \\
as a heritage to His people Israel. \\
<<135:13>> *13* Your name, O YHWH, endures forever, \\
Your renown, O YHWH, through all generations. \\
<<135:14>> *14* For YHWH will vindicate His people \\
and will have compassion on His servants. \\
<<135:15>> *15* The idols of the nations are silver and gold, \\
made by the hands of men. \\
<<135:16>> *16* They have mouths, but cannot speak; \\
they have eyes, but cannot see; \\
<<135:17>> *17* they have ears, but cannot hear; \\
nor is there breath in their mouths. \\
<<135:18>> *18* Those who make them become like them, \\
as do all who trust in them. \\
<<135:19>> *19* O house of Israel, bless YHWH; \\
O house of Aaron, bless YHWH; \\
<<135:20>> *20* O house of Levi, bless YHWH; \\
you who fear YHWH, bless YHWH! \\

“Destroy it,” they said, \\

I will sing praises to my God while I have my being. \\
<<146:3>> *3* Put not your trust in princes, \\
in mortal man, who cannot save. \\

the sea, and everything in them. \\
He remains faithful forever. \\

and gives food to the hungry. \\

<<146:8>> *8* YHWH opens the eyes of the blind, \\
YHWH lifts those who are weighed down, \\
YHWH loves the righteous. \\
<<146:9>> *9* YHWH protects foreigners; \\
He sustains the fatherless and the widow, \\
but the ways of the wicked He frustrates. \\
<<146:10>> *10* YHWH reigns forever, \\
your God, O Zion, for all generations. \\
Hallelujah! \\

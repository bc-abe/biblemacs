</p>

<p>
<a id="5-18"></a> <b>18</b> The Reubenites, the Gadites, and the half-tribe of Manasseh had 44,760 warriors&#x2014;valiant men who carried the shield and sword, drew the bow, and were trained for battle. 
<a id="5-19"></a> <b>19</b> They waged war against the Hagrites, as well as Jetur, Naphish, and Nodab.
</p>

<p>
<a id="5-20"></a> <b>20</b> And because they cried out to God in battle, they were helped against their enemies, and the Hagrites and all their allies were delivered into their hands. Because they put their trust in God, He answered their prayers. 
<a id="5-21"></a> <b>21</b> They seized the livestock of the Hagrites&#x2014;50,000 camels, 250,000 sheep, and 2,000 donkeys. They also took 100,000 captives,

<a id="5-24"></a> <b>24</b> These were the heads of their families:
</p>

<p>
Epher, Ishi, Eliel, Azriel, Jeremiah, Hodaviah, and Jahdiel.
</p>

<p>
They were mighty men of valor, famous men, and heads of their families. 
<a id="5-25"></a> <b>25</b> But they were unfaithful to the God of their fathers, and they prostituted themselves with the gods of the peoples of the land, whom God had destroyed before them.
</p>

<p>
<a id="5-26"></a> <b>26</b> So the God of Israel stirred up the spirit of Pul king of Assyria (that is, Tiglath-pileser king of Assyria) to take the Reubenites, the Gadites, and the half-tribe of Manasseh into exile. And he brought them to Halah, Habor, Hara, and the river of Gozan, where they remain to this day.

Shallum was their chief; 
<a id="9-18"></a> <b>18</b> he was previously stationed at the King&rsquo;s Gate on the east side. These were the gatekeepers from the camp of the Levites. 
<a id="9-19"></a> <b>19</b> Shallum son of Kore, the son of Ebiasaph, the son of Korah, and his relatives from the Korahites were assigned to guard the thresholds of the Tent, just as their fathers had been assigned to guard the entrance to the dwelling of the LORD.
</p>

<p>
<a id="9-20"></a> <b>20</b> In earlier times Phinehas son of Eleazar had been in charge of the gatekeepers, and the LORD was with him.
</p>

<p>
<a id="9-21"></a> <b>21</b> Zechariah son of Meshelemiah was the gatekeeper at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting.
</p>

<p>
<a id="9-22"></a> <b>22</b> The number of those chosen to be gatekeepers at the thresholds was 212. They were registered by genealogy in their villages. David and Samuel the seer had appointed them to their positions of trust.
</p>

<p>
<a id="9-23"></a> <b>23</b> So they and their descendants were assigned to guard the gates of the house of the LORD&#x2014;the house called the Tent. 
<a id="9-24"></a> <b>24</b> The gatekeepers were stationed on the four sides: east, west, north, and south. 
<a id="9-25"></a> <b>25</b> Their relatives came from their villages at fixed times to serve with them for seven-day periods. 
<a id="9-26"></a> <b>26</b> But the four chief gatekeepers, who were Levites, were entrusted with the rooms and the treasuries of the house of God. 
<a id="9-27"></a> <b>27</b> They would spend the night stationed around the house of God, because they were responsible for guarding it and opening it every morning.
</p>

<p>
<a id="9-28"></a> <b>28</b> Some of them were in charge of the articles used in worship, to count them whenever they were brought in or taken out. 
<a id="9-29"></a> <b>29</b> Others were put in charge of the furnishings and other articles of the sanctuary, as well as the fine flour, wine, oil, frankincense, and spices. 
<a id="9-30"></a> <b>30</b> And some of the sons of the priests mixed the spices.
</p>

<p>
<a id="9-31"></a> <b>31</b> A Levite named Mattithiah, the firstborn son of Shallum the Korahite, was entrusted with baking the bread. 
<a id="9-32"></a> <b>32</b> Some of their Kohathite brothers were responsible for preparing the rows of the showbread every Sabbath.
</p>

<p>
<a id="9-33"></a> <b>33</b> Those who were musicians, the heads of Levite families, stayed in the temple chambers and were exempt from other duties because they were on duty day and night. 
<a id="9-34"></a> <b>34</b> All these were heads of Levite families, chiefs according to their genealogies, and they lived in Jerusalem.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org41f7128">
<p>
<a id="11-10"></a> <b>10</b> Now these were the chiefs of David&rsquo;s mighty men, who, together with all Israel, bolstered and strengthened his kingdom, according to the word of the LORD concerning Israel. 
<a id="11-11"></a> <b>11</b> This is the list of David&rsquo;s mighty men:
</p>

<p>
Jashobeam son of Hachmoni was chief of the officers; he wielded his spear against three hundred men, whom he killed at one time.
</p>

<p>
<a id="11-12"></a> <b>12</b> Next in command was Eleazar son of Dodo the Ahohite, one of the three mighty men. 
<a id="11-13"></a> <b>13</b> He was with David at Pas-dammim when the Philistines gathered there for battle. At the place with a field full of barley, the troops fled from the Philistines. 
<a id="11-14"></a> <b>14</b> But Eleazar and David stationed themselves in the middle of the field and defended it. They struck down the Philistines, and the LORD brought about a great victory.
</p>

<p>
<a id="11-15"></a> <b>15</b> Three of the thirty chief men went down to David, to the rock at the cave of Adullam, while a company of Philistines was encamped in the Valley of Rephaim. 
<a id="11-16"></a> <b>16</b> At that time David was in the stronghold, and the garrison of the Philistines was at Bethlehem. 
<a id="11-17"></a> <b>17</b> David longed for water and said, “Oh, that someone would get me a drink of water from the well near the gate of Bethlehem!”
</p>

<p>
<a id="11-18"></a> <b>18</b> So the Three broke through the Philistine camp, drew water from the well at the gate of Bethlehem, and brought it back to David. But he refused to drink it; instead, he poured it out to the LORD, 
<a id="11-19"></a> <b>19</b> saying, “Far be it from me, my God, to do this! How can I drink the blood of these men who risked their lives?” Because they had brought it at the risk of their lives, David refused to drink it.
</p>

<p>
Such were the exploits of the three mighty men.
</p>

<p>
<a id="11-20"></a> <b>20</b> Now Abishai, the brother of Joab, was chief of the Three, and he lifted his spear against three hundred men, killed them, and won a name along with the Three. 
<a id="11-21"></a> <b>21</b> He was doubly honored above the Three, and he became their commander, even though he was not included among the Three.
</p>

<p>
<a id="11-22"></a> <b>22</b> And Benaiah son of Jehoiada was a man of valor from Kabzeel, a man of many exploits. He struck down two champions of Moab, and on a snowy day he went down into a pit and killed a lion. 
<a id="11-23"></a> <b>23</b> He also killed an Egyptian, a huge man five cubits tall. Although the Egyptian had a spear like a weaver&rsquo;s beam in his hand, Benaiah went against him with a club, snatched the spear from his hand, and killed the Egyptian with his own spear. 
<a id="11-24"></a> <b>24</b> These were the exploits of Benaiah son of Jehoiada, who won a name alongside the three mighty men. 
<a id="11-25"></a> <b>25</b> He was most honored among the Thirty, but he did not become one of the Three. And David appointed him over his guard.

</p>

<p>
<a id="12-8"></a> <b>8</b> Some Gadites defected to David at his stronghold in the desert. They were mighty men of valor, trained for battle, experts with the shield and spear, whose faces were like the faces of lions and who were as swift as gazelles on the mountains:
</p>

<p>
<a id="12-9"></a> <b>9</b> Ezer the chief, Obadiah the second in command, Eliab the third, 
<a id="12-10"></a> <b>10</b> Mishmannah the fourth, Jeremiah the fifth,

<a id="12-13"></a> <b>13</b> Jeremiah the tenth, and Machbanai the eleventh.
</p>

<p>
<a id="12-14"></a> <b>14</b> These Gadites were army commanders, the least of whom was a match for a hundred, and the greatest for a thousand.
</p>

<p>
<a id="12-15"></a> <b>15</b> These are the ones who crossed the Jordan in the first month when it was overflowing all its banks, and they put to flight all those in the valleys, both to the east and to the west.
</p>

<p>
<a id="12-16"></a> <b>16</b> Other Benjamites and some men from Judah also came to David in his stronghold. 
<a id="12-17"></a> <b>17</b> And David went out to meet them, saying, “If you have come to me in peace to help me, my heart will be united with you; but if you have come to betray me to my enemies when my hands are free of violence, may the God of our fathers see it and judge you.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="12-18"></a> <b>18</b> Then the Spirit came upon Amasai, the chief of the Thirty, and he said:

“We are yours, O David!

<p>
Peace, peace to you,

and peace to your helpers,

<a id="17-5"></a> <b>5</b> For I have not dwelt in a house from the day I brought Israel up out of Egypt until this day, but I have moved from tent to tent and dwelling to dwelling. 
<a id="17-6"></a> <b>6</b> In all My journeys with all the Israelites, have I ever asked any of the leaders I appointed to shepherd My people, ‘Why haven&rsquo;t you built Me a house of cedar?&rsquo;
</p>

<p>
<a id="17-7"></a> <b>7</b> Now then, you are to tell My servant David that this is what the LORD of Hosts says: I took you from the pasture, from following the flock, to be the ruler over My people Israel. 
<a id="17-8"></a> <b>8</b> I have been with you wherever you have gone, and I have cut off all your enemies from before you. Now I will make for you a name like the greatest in the land.
</p>

<p>
<a id="17-9"></a> <b>9</b> And I will provide a place for My people Israel and will plant them so that they may dwell in a place of their own and be disturbed no more. No longer will the sons of wickedness oppress them as they did at the beginning 
<a id="17-10"></a> <b>10</b> and have done since the day I appointed judges over My people Israel. And I will subdue all your enemies.
</p>

<p>
Moreover, I declare to you that the LORD will build a house for you. 
<a id="17-11"></a> <b>11</b> And when your days are fulfilled and you go to be with your fathers, I will raise up your descendant after you, one of your own sons, and I will establish his kingdom. 
<a id="17-12"></a> <b>12</b> He will build a house for Me, and I will establish his throne forever. 
<a id="17-13"></a> <b>13</b> I will be his Father, and he will be My son. And I will never remove My loving devotion from him as I removed it from your predecessor. 
<a id="17-14"></a> <b>14</b> But I will set him over My house and My kingdom forever, and his throne will be established forever.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="17-15"></a> <b>15</b> So Nathan relayed to David all the words of this entire vision.

So David sent messengers to console Hanun concerning his father. But when David&rsquo;s servants arrived in the land of the Ammonites to console him,

</p>

<p>
<a id="19-4"></a> <b>4</b> So Hanun took David&rsquo;s servants, shaved their beards, cut off their garments at the hips, and sent them away.

<p>
<a id="19-5"></a> <b>5</b> When someone came and told David about his men, he sent messengers to meet them, since the men had been thoroughly humiliated. The king told them, “Stay in Jericho until your beards have grown back, and then return.”

<p>
<a id="19-6"></a> <b>6</b> When the Ammonites realized that they had become a stench to David, Hanun and the Ammonites sent a thousand talents of silver to hire for themselves chariots and horsemen from Aram-naharaim, Aram-maacah, and Zobah. 
<a id="19-7"></a> <b>7</b> So they hired for themselves thirty-two thousand chariots, as well as the king of Maacah with his troops, who came and camped near Medeba while the Ammonites came from their cities and marched out for battle.

<p>
<a id="19-16"></a> <b>16</b> When the Arameans saw that they had been defeated by Israel, they sent messengers to bring more Arameans from beyond the Euphrates, with Shophach the commander of Hadadezer&rsquo;s army leading them.
</p>

<p>
<a id="19-17"></a> <b>17</b> When this was reported to David, he gathered all Israel, crossed the Jordan, advanced toward the Arameans, and arrayed for battle against them. When David lined up to engage them in battle, they fought against him. 
<a id="19-18"></a> <b>18</b> But the Arameans fled before Israel, and David killed seven thousand of their charioteers and forty thousand foot soldiers. He also killed Shophach the commander of their army.

<a id="22-8"></a> <b>8</b> but this word of the LORD came to me: ‘You have shed much blood and waged great wars. You are not to build a house for My Name because you have shed so much blood on the ground before Me. 
<a id="22-9"></a> <b>9</b> But a son will be born to you who will be a man of rest. I will give him rest from all his enemies on every side; for his name will be Solomon, and I will grant to Israel peace and quiet during his reign. 
<a id="22-10"></a> <b>10</b> He is the one who will build a house for My Name. He will be My son, and I will be his Father. And I will establish the throne of his kingdom over Israel forever.&rsquo;

<p>
<a id="22-11"></a> <b>11</b> Now, my son, may the LORD be with you, and may you succeed in building the house of the LORD your God, as He said you would. 
<a id="22-12"></a> <b>12</b> Above all, may the LORD give you insight and understanding when He puts you in command over Israel, so that you may keep the Law of the LORD your God. 
<a id="22-13"></a> <b>13</b> Then you will succeed, if you carefully follow the statutes and ordinances that the LORD commanded Moses for Israel. Be strong and courageous. Do not be afraid or discouraged.
</p>

<p>
<a id="22-14"></a> <b>14</b> Now behold, I have taken great pains to provide for the house of the LORD&#x2014;100,000 talents of gold, 1,000,000 talents of silver, and bronze and iron too great to be weighed. I have also provided timber and stone, and you may add to them.
</p>

<p>
<a id="22-15"></a> <b>15</b> You also have many workers: stonecutters, masons, carpenters, and men skilled in every kind of work&#x2014; 
<a id="22-16"></a> <b>16</b> in gold and silver, bronze and iron&#x2014;craftsmen beyond number. Now begin the work, and may the LORD be with you.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="22-17"></a> <b>17</b> Then David ordered all the leaders of Israel to help his son Solomon:
<a id="22-18"></a> <b>18</b> “Is not the LORD your God with you, and has He not granted you rest on every side? For He has given the inhabitants of the land into my hand, and the land has been subdued before the LORD and His people. 
<a id="22-19"></a> <b>19</b> Now set your heart and soul to seek the LORD your God. Get started building the sanctuary of the LORD God, so that you may bring the ark of the covenant of the LORD and the holy articles of God into the temple that will be built for the Name of the LORD.”

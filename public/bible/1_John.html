<a id="2-7"></a> <b>7</b> Beloved, I am not writing to you a new commandment, but an old one, which you have had from the beginning. This commandment is the message you have heard. 
<a id="2-8"></a> <b>8</b> Then again, I am also writing to you a new commandment, which is true in Him and also in you. For the darkness is fading and the true light is already shining.

<p>
<a id="2-9"></a> <b>9</b> If anyone claims to be in the light but hates his brother, he is still in the darkness.

<a id="2-19"></a> <b>19</b> They went out from us, but they did not belong to us. For if they had belonged to us, they would have remained with us. But their departure made it clear that none of them belonged to us.

<a id="2-22"></a> <b>22</b> Who is the liar, if it is not the one who denies that Jesus is the Christ? This is the antichrist, who denies the Father and the Son.

<a id="2-26"></a> <b>26</b> I have written these things to you about those who are trying to deceive you. 
<a id="2-27"></a> <b>27</b> And as for you, the anointing you received from Him remains in you, and you do not need anyone to teach you. But just as His true and genuine anointing teaches you about all things, so remain in Him as you have been taught.
</p>

<p>
<a id="2-28"></a> <b>28</b> And now, little children, remain in Christ, so that when He appears, we may be confident and unashamed before Him at His coming.

<a id="3-2"></a> <b>2</b> Beloved, we are now children of God, and what we will be has not yet been revealed. We know that when Christ appears, we will be like Him, for we will see Him as He is.

<a id="3-5"></a> <b>5</b> But you know that Christ appeared to take away sins, and in Him there is no sin. 
<a id="3-6"></a> <b>6</b> No one who remains in Him keeps on sinning. No one who continues to sin has seen Him or known Him.

<a id="3-7"></a> <b>7</b> Little children, let no one deceive you: The one who practices righteousness is righteous, just as Christ is righteous. 
<a id="3-8"></a> <b>8</b> The one who practices sin is of the devil, because the devil has been sinning from the very start. This is why the Son of God was revealed, to destroy the works of the devil.
</p>

<p>
<a id="3-9"></a> <b>9</b> Anyone born of God refuses to practice sin, because God&rsquo;s seed abides in him; he cannot go on sinning, because he has been born of God.

<p>
<a id="3-14"></a> <b>14</b> We know that we have passed from death to life, because we love our brothers. The one who does not love remains in death.

<a id="4-8"></a> <b>8</b> Whoever does not love does not know God, because God is love.
</p>

<p>
<a id="4-9"></a> <b>9</b> This is how God&rsquo;s love was revealed among us: God sent His one and only Son into the world, so that we might live through Him. 
<a id="4-10"></a> <b>10</b> And love consists in this: not that we loved God, but that He loved us and sent His Son as the atoning sacrifice for our sins.

<a id="4-11"></a> <b>11</b> Beloved, if God so loved us, we also ought to love one another. 
<a id="4-12"></a> <b>12</b> No one has ever seen God; but if we love one another, God remains in us, and His love is perfected in us. 
<a id="4-13"></a> <b>13</b> By this we know that we remain in Him, and He in us: He has given us of His Spirit.

<a id="4-15"></a> <b>15</b> If anyone confesses that Jesus is the Son of God, God abides in him, and he in God. 
<a id="4-16"></a> <b>16</b> And we have come to know and believe the love that God has for us. God is love; whoever abides in love abides in God, and God in him. 
<a id="4-17"></a> <b>17</b> In this way, love has been perfected among us, so that we may have confidence on the day of judgment; for in this world we are just like Him.
</p>

<p>
<a id="4-18"></a> <b>18</b> There is no fear in love, but perfect love drives out fear, because fear involves punishment. The one who fears has not been perfected in love.

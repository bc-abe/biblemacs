<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org5938300">
<p>
<a id="1-1"></a> Now King David was old and well along in years, and though they covered him with blankets, he could not keep warm. 
<a id="1-2"></a> <b>2</b> So his servants said to him, “Let us search for a young virgin for our lord the king, to attend to him and care for him and lie by his side to keep him warm.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="1-3"></a> <b>3</b> Then they searched throughout Israel for a beautiful girl, and they found Abishag the Shunammite and brought her to the king. 
<a id="1-4"></a> <b>4</b> The girl was unsurpassed in beauty; she cared for the king and served him, but he had no relations with her.

<h3 id="org0d40ba5">Adonijah Usurps the Kingdom</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org0d40ba5">
<p>
<a id="1-5"></a> <b>5</b> At that time Adonijah, David&rsquo;s son by Haggith, began to exalt himself, saying, “I will be king!” And he acquired chariots and horsemen and fifty men to run ahead of him.
</p>

<p>
6(His father had never once reprimanded him by saying, “Why do you act this way?” Adonijah was also very handsome, born next after Absalom.)
</p>

<p>
<a id="1-7"></a> <b>7</b> So Adonijah conferred with Joab son of Zeruiah and with Abiathar the priest, who supported him. 
<a id="1-8"></a> <b>8</b> But Zadok the priest, Benaiah son of Jehoiada, Nathan the prophet, Shimei, Rei, and David&rsquo;s mighty men would not join Adonijah.
</p>

<p>
<a id="1-9"></a> <b>9</b> And Adonijah sacrificed sheep, oxen, and fattened calves near the stone of Zoheleth, which is next to En-rogel. He invited all his royal brothers and all the men of Judah who were servants of the king. 
<a id="1-10"></a> <b>10</b> But he did not invite Nathan the prophet, Benaiah, the mighty men, or his brother Solomon.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-orgb523190" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orgb523190">Nathan and Bathsheba before David</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgb523190">
<p>
<a id="1-11"></a> <b>11</b> Then Nathan said to Bathsheba the mother of Solomon, “Have you not heard that Adonijah son of Haggith has become king, and our lord David does not know it? 
<a id="1-12"></a> <b>12</b> Now please, come and let me advise you. Save your own life and the life of your son Solomon. 
<a id="1-13"></a> <b>13</b> Go at once to King David and say, ‘My lord the king, did you not swear to your maidservant, “Surely your son Solomon will reign after me, and he will sit on my throne”? Why then has Adonijah become king?&rsquo; 
<a id="1-14"></a> <b>14</b> Then, while you are still there speaking with the king, I will come in after you and confirm your words.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="1-15"></a> <b>15</b> So Bathsheba went to see the king in his bedroom. Since the king was very old, Abishag the Shunammite was serving him. 
<a id="1-16"></a> <b>16</b> And Bathsheba bowed down in homage to the king, who asked, “What is your desire?”
</p>

<p>
<a id="1-17"></a> <b>17</b> “My lord,” she replied, “you yourself swore to your maidservant by the LORD your God: ‘Surely your son Solomon will reign after me, and he will sit on my throne.&rsquo; 
<a id="1-18"></a> <b>18</b> But now, behold, Adonijah has become king, and you, my lord the king, did not know it. 
<a id="1-19"></a> <b>19</b> And he has sacrificed an abundance of oxen, fattened calves, and sheep, and has invited all the other sons of the king, as well as Abiathar the priest and Joab the commander of the army. But he did not invite your servant Solomon. 
<a id="1-20"></a> <b>20</b> And as for you, my lord the king, the eyes of all Israel are upon you to tell them who will sit on the throne of my lord the king after him. 
<a id="1-21"></a> <b>21</b> Otherwise, when my lord the king rests with his fathers, I and my son Solomon will be counted as criminals.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="1-22"></a> <b>22</b> And just then, while Bathsheba was still speaking with the king, Nathan the prophet arrived. 
<a id="1-23"></a> <b>23</b> So the king was told, “Nathan the prophet is here.” And Nathan went in and bowed facedown before the king.
</p>

<p>
<a id="1-24"></a> <b>24</b> “My lord the king,” said Nathan, “did you say, ‘Adonijah will reign after me, and he will sit on my throne&rsquo;? 
<a id="1-25"></a> <b>25</b> For today he has gone down and sacrificed an abundance of oxen, fattened calves, and sheep, and has invited all the sons of the king, the commanders of the army, and Abiathar the priest. And behold, they are eating and drinking before him, saying, ‘Long live King Adonijah!&rsquo; 
<a id="1-26"></a> <b>26</b> But me your servant he did not invite, nor Zadok the priest, nor Benaiah son of Jehoiada, nor your servant Solomon. 
<a id="1-27"></a> <b>27</b> Has my lord the king let this happen without informing your servant who should sit on the throne after my lord the king?”

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org1b3b304">
<p>
<a id="1-28"></a> <b>28</b> Then King David said, “Call in Bathsheba for me.” So she came into the king&rsquo;s presence and stood before him.
</p>

<p>
<a id="1-29"></a> <b>29</b> And the king swore an oath, saying, “As surely as the LORD lives, who has redeemed my life from all distress, 
<a id="1-30"></a> <b>30</b> I will carry out this very day exactly what I swore to you by the LORD, the God of Israel: Surely your son Solomon will reign after me, and he will sit on my throne in my place.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="1-31"></a> <b>31</b> Bathsheba bowed facedown in homage to the king and said, “May my lord King David live forever!”

<h3 id="orgb65da99">Solomon Anointed King (1 Chronicles 29:21&#x2013;25)</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgb65da99">
<p>
<a id="1-32"></a> <b>32</b> Then King David said, “Call in for me Zadok the priest, Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah son of Jehoiada.” So they came before the king.
</p>

<p>
<a id="1-33"></a> <b>33</b> “Take my servants with you,” said the king. “Set my son Solomon on my own mule and take him down to Gihon. 
<a id="1-34"></a> <b>34</b> There Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet are to anoint him king over Israel. You are to blow the ram&rsquo;s horn and declare, ‘Long live King Solomon!&rsquo; 
<a id="1-35"></a> <b>35</b> Then you shall go up with him, and he is to come and sit on my throne and reign in my place. For I have appointed him ruler over Israel and Judah.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="1-36"></a> <b>36</b> “Amen,” replied Benaiah son of Jehoiada. “May the LORD, the God of my lord the king, so declare it. 
<a id="1-37"></a> <b>37</b> Just as the LORD was with my lord the king, so may He be with Solomon and make his throne even greater than that of my lord King David.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="1-38"></a> <b>38</b> Then Zadok the priest, Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah son of Jehoiada, along with the Cherethites and Pelethites, went down and set Solomon on King David&rsquo;s mule, and they escorted him to Gihon. 
<a id="1-39"></a> <b>39</b> Zadok the priest took the horn of oil from the tabernacle and anointed Solomon. Then they blew the ram&rsquo;s horn, and all the people proclaimed, “Long live King Solomon!”
</p>

<p>
<a id="1-40"></a> <b>40</b> All the people followed him, playing flutes and rejoicing with such a great joy that the earth was split by the sound.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org82a8589">
<p>
<a id="1-41"></a> <b>41</b> Now Adonijah and all his guests were finishing their feast when they heard the sound of the ram&rsquo;s horn. “Why is the city in such a loud uproar?” asked Joab.
</p>

<p>
<a id="1-42"></a> <b>42</b> As he was speaking, suddenly Jonathan the son of Abiathar the priest arrived. “Come in,” said Adonijah, “for you are a man of valor. You must be bringing good news.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="1-43"></a> <b>43</b> “Not at all,” Jonathan replied. “Our lord King David has made Solomon king. 
<a id="1-44"></a> <b>44</b> And with Solomon, the king has sent Zadok the priest, Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah son of Jehoiada, along with the Cherethites and Pelethites, and they have set him on the king&rsquo;s mule. 
<a id="1-45"></a> <b>45</b> Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet have anointed him king at Gihon, and they have gone up from there with rejoicing that rings out in the city. That is the noise you hear.
</p>

<p>
<a id="1-46"></a> <b>46</b> Moreover, Solomon has taken his seat on the royal throne.
</p>

<p>
<a id="1-47"></a> <b>47</b> The king&rsquo;s servants have also gone to congratulate our lord King David, saying, ‘May your God make the name of Solomon more famous than your own name, and may He make his throne greater than your throne.&rsquo;
</p>

<p>
And the king has bowed in worship on his bed, 
<a id="1-48"></a> <b>48</b> saying, ‘Blessed be the LORD, the God of Israel! Today He has provided one to sit on my throne, and my eyes have seen it.&rsquo; ”
</p>

<p>
<a id="1-49"></a> <b>49</b> At this, all the guests of Adonijah arose in terror and scattered. 
<a id="1-50"></a> <b>50</b> But Adonijah, in fear of Solomon, got up and went to take hold of the horns of the altar.
</p>

<p>
<a id="1-51"></a> <b>51</b> It was reported to Solomon: “Behold, Adonijah fears King Solomon, and he has taken hold of the horns of the altar, saying, ‘Let King Solomon first swear to me not to put his servant to the sword.&rsquo; ”
</p>

<p>
<a id="1-52"></a> <b>52</b> And Solomon replied, “If he is a man of character, not a single hair of his will fall to the ground. But if evil is found in him, he will die.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="1-53"></a> <b>53</b> So King Solomon summoned Adonijah down from the altar, and he came and bowed down before King Solomon, who said to him, “Go to your home.”

</p>

<p>
<a id="2-1"></a> As the time drew near for David to die, he charged his son Solomon,
<a id="2-2"></a> <b>2</b> “I am about to go the way of all the earth. So be strong and prove yourself a man. 
<a id="2-3"></a> <b>3</b> And keep the charge of the LORD your God to walk in His ways and to keep His statutes, commandments, ordinances, and decrees, as is written in the Law of Moses, so that you may prosper in all you do and wherever you turn, 
<a id="2-4"></a> <b>4</b> and so that the LORD may fulfill His promise to me: ‘If your descendants take heed to walk faithfully before Me with all their heart and soul, you will never fail to have a man on the throne of Israel.&rsquo;
</p>

<p>
<a id="2-5"></a> <b>5</b> Moreover, you know what Joab son of Zeruiah did to me&#x2014;what he did to Abner son of Ner and Amasa son of Jether, the two commanders of the armies of Israel. He killed them in peacetime to avenge the blood of war. He stained with the blood of war the belt around his waist and the sandals on his feet. 
<a id="2-6"></a> <b>6</b> So act according to your wisdom, and do not let his gray head go down to Sheol in peace.
</p>

<p>
<a id="2-7"></a> <b>7</b> But show loving devotion to the sons of Barzillai the Gileadite, and let them be among those who eat at your table, because they stood by me when I fled from your brother Absalom.
</p>

<p>
<a id="2-8"></a> <b>8</b> Keep an eye on Shimei the son of Gera, the Benjamite from Bahurim who is with you. He called down bitter curses against me on the day I went to Mahanaim, but when he came down to meet me at the Jordan, I swore to him by the LORD: ‘I will never put you to the sword.&rsquo; 
<a id="2-9"></a> <b>9</b> Now therefore, do not hold him guiltless, for you are a wise man. You know what you ought to do to him to bring his gray head down to Sheol in blood.”

<a id="2-10"></a> <b>10</b> Then David rested with his fathers and was buried in the City of David. 
<a id="2-11"></a> <b>11</b> The length of David&rsquo;s reign over Israel was forty years&#x2014;seven years in Hebron and thirty-three years in Jerusalem.

<a id="2-12"></a> <b>12</b> So Solomon sat on the throne of his father David, and his kingdom was firmly established.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org59df322">
<p>
<a id="2-13"></a> <b>13</b> Now Adonijah son of Haggith went to Bathsheba the mother of Solomon, and she asked, “Do you come in peace?”
</p>

<p>
“Yes, in peace,” he replied. 
<a id="2-14"></a> <b>14</b> Then he said, “I have something to tell you.”
</p>

<p>
“Say it,” she answered.
</p>

<p>
<a id="2-15"></a> <b>15</b> “You know that the kingship was mine,” he said. “All Israel expected that I should reign, but the kingship has turned to my brother, for it has come to him from the LORD. 
<a id="2-16"></a> <b>16</b> So now I have just one request of you; do not deny me.”
</p>

<p>
“State your request,” she told him.
</p>

<p>
<a id="2-17"></a> <b>17</b> Adonijah replied, “Please speak to King Solomon, since he will not turn you down. Let him give me Abishag the Shunammite as my wife.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="2-18"></a> <b>18</b> “Very well,” Bathsheba replied. “I will speak to the king for you.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="2-19"></a> <b>19</b> So Bathsheba went to King Solomon to speak to him for Adonijah. The king stood up to greet her, bowed to her, and sat down on his throne. Then the king had a throne brought for his mother, who sat down at his right hand.
</p>

<p>
<a id="2-20"></a> <b>20</b> “I have just one small request of you,” she said. “Do not deny me.”
</p>

<p>
“Make your request, my mother,” the king replied, “for I will not deny you.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="2-21"></a> <b>21</b> So Bathsheba said, “Let Abishag the Shunammite be given to your brother Adonijah as his wife.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="2-22"></a> <b>22</b> King Solomon answered his mother, “Why do you request Abishag the Shunammite for Adonijah? Since he is my older brother, you might as well request the kingdom for him and for Abiathar the priest and for Joab son of Zeruiah!”
</p>

<p>
<a id="2-23"></a> <b>23</b> Then King Solomon swore by the LORD: “May God punish me, and ever so severely, if Adonijah has not made this request at the expense of his life. 
<a id="2-24"></a> <b>24</b> And now, as surely as the LORD lives&#x2014;the One who established me, who set me on the throne of my father David, and who founded for me a dynasty as He promised&#x2014;surely Adonijah shall be put to death today!”
</p>

<p>
<a id="2-25"></a> <b>25</b> So King Solomon sent the order to Benaiah son of Jehoiada, who struck down Adonijah, and he died.
</p>

<p>
<a id="2-26"></a> <b>26</b> Then the king said to Abiathar the priest, “Go back to your fields in Anathoth. Even though you deserve to die, I will not put you to death at this time, since you carried the ark of the Lord GOD before my father David, and you suffered through all that my father suffered.” 
<a id="2-27"></a> <b>27</b> So Solomon banished Abiathar from the priesthood of the LORD and thus fulfilled the word that the LORD had spoken at Shiloh against the house of Eli.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org264e121" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org264e121">The Execution of Joab</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org264e121">
<p>
<a id="2-28"></a> <b>28</b> When the news reached Joab, who had conspired with Adonijah but not with Absalom, he fled to the tent of the LORD and took hold of the horns of the altar.
</p>

<p>
<a id="2-29"></a> <b>29</b> It was reported to King Solomon: “Joab has fled to the tent of the LORD and is now beside the altar.”
</p>

<p>
So Solomon sent Benaiah son of Jehoiada, saying, “Go, strike him down!”
</p>

<p>
<a id="2-30"></a> <b>30</b> And Benaiah entered the tent of the LORD and said to Joab, “The king says, ‘Come out!&rsquo; ”
</p>

<p>
But Joab replied, “No, I will die here.”
</p>

<p>
So Benaiah relayed the message to the king, saying, “This is how Joab answered me.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="2-31"></a> <b>31</b> And the king replied, “Do just as he says. Strike him down and bury him, and so remove from me and from the house of my father the innocent blood that Joab shed. 
<a id="2-32"></a> <b>32</b> The LORD will bring his bloodshed back upon his own head, for without the knowledge of my father David he struck down two men more righteous and better than he when he put to the sword Abner son of Ner, commander of Israel&rsquo;s army, and Amasa son of Jether, commander of Judah&rsquo;s army. 
<a id="2-33"></a> <b>33</b> Their blood will come back upon the heads of Joab and his descendants forever; but for David, his descendants, his house, and his throne, there shall be peace from the LORD forever.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="2-34"></a> <b>34</b> So Benaiah son of Jehoiada went up, struck down Joab, and killed him. He was buried at his own home in the wilderness. 
<a id="2-35"></a> <b>35</b> And the king appointed Benaiah son of Jehoiada in Joab&rsquo;s place over the army, and he appointed Zadok the priest in Abiathar&rsquo;s place.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgbdb97a9">

<a id="2-36"></a> <b>36</b> Then the king summoned Shimei and said to him, “Build a house for yourself in Jerusalem and live there, but do not go anywhere else. 
<a id="2-37"></a> <b>37</b> On the day you go out and cross the Kidron Valley, know for sure that you will die; your blood will be on your own head.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="2-38"></a> <b>38</b> “The sentence is fair,” Shimei replied. “Your servant will do as my lord the king has spoken.” And Shimei lived in Jerusalem for a long time.
</p>

<p>
<a id="2-39"></a> <b>39</b> After three years, however, two of Shimei&rsquo;s slaves ran away to Achish son of Maacah, king of Gath. And Shimei was told, “Look, your slaves are in Gath.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="2-40"></a> <b>40</b> So Shimei saddled his donkey and set out to Achish at Gath in search of his slaves, and he brought them back from Gath.
</p>

<p>
<a id="2-41"></a> <b>41</b> When Solomon was told that Shimei had gone from Jerusalem to Gath and had returned, 
<a id="2-42"></a> <b>42</b> the king summoned Shimei and said to him, “Did I not make you swear by the LORD and warn you, ‘On the day you leave and go elsewhere, know for sure that you will die&rsquo;? And you told me, ‘The sentence is fair; I will comply.&rsquo; 
<a id="2-43"></a> <b>43</b> So why have you not kept your oath to the LORD and the command that I gave you?”
</p>

<p>
<a id="2-44"></a> <b>44</b> The king also said, “You know in your heart all the evil that you did to my father David. Therefore the LORD will bring your evil back upon your head. 
<a id="2-45"></a> <b>45</b> But King Solomon will be blessed and David&rsquo;s throne will remain secure before the LORD forever.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="2-46"></a> <b>46</b> Then the king commanded Benaiah son of Jehoiada, and he went out and struck Shimei down, and he died. Thus the kingdom was firmly established in the hand of Solomon.

<a id="3-9"></a> <b>9</b> Therefore give Your servant an understanding heart to judge Your people and to discern between good and evil. For who is able to govern this great people of Yours?”
</p>

<p>
<a id="3-10"></a> <b>10</b> Now it pleased the Lord that Solomon had made this request. 
<a id="3-11"></a> <b>11</b> So God said to him, “Since you have asked for this instead of requesting long life or wealth for yourself or death for your enemies&#x2014;but you have asked for discernment to administer justice&#x2014; 
<a id="3-12"></a> <b>12</b> behold, I will do what you have asked. I will give you a wise and discerning heart, so that there has never been nor will ever be another like you.
</p>

<p>
<a id="3-13"></a> <b>13</b> Moreover, I will give you what you did not request&#x2014;both riches and honor&#x2014;so that during all your days no man in any kingdom will be your equal. 
<a id="3-14"></a> <b>14</b> So if you walk in My ways and keep My statutes and commandments, just as your father David did, I will prolong your days.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="3-15"></a> <b>15</b> Then Solomon awoke, and indeed it had been a dream. So he returned to Jerusalem, stood before the ark of the covenant of the Lord, and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings. Then he held a feast for all his servants.

<a id="3-16"></a> <b>16</b> At that time two prostitutes came to the king and stood before him.
</p>

<p>
<a id="3-17"></a> <b>17</b> One woman said, “Please, my lord, this woman and I live in the same house, and I gave birth while she was in the house. 
<a id="3-18"></a> <b>18</b> On the third day after I gave birth, this woman also had a baby. We were alone, with no one in the house but the two of us. 
<a id="3-19"></a> <b>19</b> During the night this woman&rsquo;s son died because she rolled over on him. 
<a id="3-20"></a> <b>20</b> So she got up in the middle of the night and took my son from my side while I was asleep. She laid him in her bosom and put her dead son at my bosom. 
<a id="3-21"></a> <b>21</b> The next morning, when I got up to nurse my son, I discovered he was dead. But when I examined him, I realized that he was not the son I had borne.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="3-22"></a> <b>22</b> “No,” said the other woman, “the living one is my son and the dead one is your son.”
</p>

<p>
But the first woman insisted, “No, the dead one is yours and the living one is mine.” So they argued before the king.
</p>

<p>
<a id="3-23"></a> <b>23</b> Then the king replied, “This woman says, ‘My son is alive and yours is dead,&rsquo; but that woman says, ‘No, your son is dead and mine is alive.&rsquo; ”
</p>

<p>
<a id="3-24"></a> <b>24</b> The king continued, “Bring me a sword.” So they brought him a sword, 
<a id="3-25"></a> <b>25</b> and the king declared, “Cut the living child in two and give half to one and half to the other.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="3-26"></a> <b>26</b> Then the woman whose son was alive spoke to the king because she yearned with compassion for her son. “Please, my lord,” she said, “give her the living baby. Do not kill him!”
</p>

<p>
But the other woman said, “He will be neither mine nor yours. Cut him in two!”
</p>

<p>
<a id="3-27"></a> <b>27</b> Then the king gave his ruling: “Give the living baby to the first woman. By no means should you kill him; she is his mother.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="3-28"></a> <b>28</b> When all Israel heard of the judgment the king had given, they stood in awe of him, for they saw that the wisdom of God was in him to administer justice.

<p>
<a id="5-3"></a> <b>3</b> “As you are well aware, due to the wars waged on all sides against my father David, he could not build a house for the Name of the LORD his God until the LORD had put his enemies under his feet.

<p>
<a id="5-5"></a> <b>5</b> So behold, I plan to build a house for the Name of the LORD my God, according to what the LORD said to my father David: ‘I will put your son on your throne in your place, and he will build the house for My Name.&rsquo;
</p>

<p>
<a id="5-6"></a> <b>6</b> Now therefore, order that cedars of Lebanon be cut down for me. My servants will be with your servants, and I will pay your servants whatever wages you set, for you know that there are none among us as skilled in logging as the Sidonians.”

“I have received your message; I will do all you desire regarding the cedar and cypress timber.

<a id="7-14"></a> <b>14</b> He was the son of a widow from the tribe of Naphtali, and his father was a man of Tyre, a craftsman in bronze. Huram had great skill, understanding, and knowledge for every kind of bronze work. So he came to King Solomon and carried out all his work.
</p>

<p>
<a id="7-15"></a> <b>15</b> He cast two pillars of bronze, each eighteen cubits high and twelve cubits in circumference. 
<a id="7-16"></a> <b>16</b> He also made two capitals of cast bronze to set on top of the pillars, each capital five cubits high. 
<a id="7-17"></a> <b>17</b> For the capitals on top of the pillars he made a network of lattice, with wreaths of chainwork, seven for each capital.
</p>

<p>
<a id="7-18"></a> <b>18</b> Likewise, he made the pillars with two rows of pomegranates around each grating to cover each capital atop the pillars. 
<a id="7-19"></a> <b>19</b> And the capitals atop the pillars in the portico were shaped like lilies, four cubits high. 
<a id="7-20"></a> <b>20</b> On the capitals of both pillars, just above the rounded projection next to the network, were the two hundred pomegranates in rows encircling each capital.
</p>

<p>
<a id="7-21"></a> <b>21</b> Thus he set up the pillars at the portico of the temple. The pillar to the south he named Jachin, and the pillar to the north he named Boaz.

<a id="7-34"></a> <b>34</b> Each stand had four handles, one for each corner, projecting from the stand. 
<a id="7-35"></a> <b>35</b> At the top of each stand was a circular band half a cubit high. The supports and panels were cast as a unit with the top of the stand.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org4969720">
<p>
<a id="9-10"></a> <b>10</b> Now at the end of the twenty years during which Solomon built these two houses, the house of the LORD and the royal palace, 
<a id="9-11"></a> <b>11</b> King Solomon gave twenty towns in the land of Galilee to Hiram king of Tyre, who had supplied him with cedar and cypress logs and gold for his every desire. 
<a id="9-12"></a> <b>12</b> So Hiram went out from Tyre to inspect the towns that Solomon had given him, but he was not pleased with them.
</p>

<p>
<a id="9-13"></a> <b>13</b> “What are these towns you have given me, my brother?” asked Hiram, and he called them the Land of Cabul, as they are called to this day.
</p>

<p>
<a id="9-14"></a> <b>14</b> And Hiram had sent the king 120 talents of gold.
</p>

<p>
<a id="9-15"></a> <b>15</b> This is the account of the forced labor that King Solomon imposed to build the house of the LORD, his own palace, the supporting terraces, and the wall of Jerusalem, as well as Hazor, Megiddo, and Gezer.
</p>

<p>
<a id="9-16"></a> <b>16</b> Pharaoh king of Egypt had attacked and captured Gezer. He had set it on fire, killed the Canaanites who lived in the city, and given it as a dowry to his daughter, Solomon&rsquo;s wife. 
<a id="9-17"></a> <b>17</b> So Solomon rebuilt Gezer, Lower Beth-horon, 
<a id="9-18"></a> <b>18</b> Baalath, and Tamar in the Wilderness of Judah, 
<a id="9-19"></a> <b>19</b> as well as all the store cities that Solomon had for his chariots and horses &#x2014;whatever he desired to build in Jerusalem, Lebanon, and throughout the land of his dominion.
</p>

<p>
<a id="9-20"></a> <b>20</b> As for all the people who remained of the Amorites, Hittites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites (the people who were not Israelites)&#x2014; 
<a id="9-21"></a> <b>21</b> their descendants who remained in the land, those whom the Israelites were unable to devote to destruction&#x2014;Solomon conscripted these people to be forced laborers, as they are to this day.
</p>

<p>
<a id="9-22"></a> <b>22</b> But Solomon did not consign any of the Israelites to slavery, because they were his men of war, his servants, his officers, his captains, and the commanders of his chariots and cavalry. 
<a id="9-23"></a> <b>23</b> They were also the chief officers over Solomon&rsquo;s projects: 550 supervisors over the people who did the work.
</p>

<p>
<a id="9-24"></a> <b>24</b> As soon as Pharaoh&rsquo;s daughter had come up from the City of David to the palace that Solomon had built for her, he built the supporting terraces.
</p>

<p>
<a id="9-25"></a> <b>25</b> Three times a year Solomon offered burnt offerings and peace offerings on the altar he had built for the LORD, burning incense with them before the LORD. So he completed the temple.
</p>

<p>
<a id="9-26"></a> <b>26</b> King Solomon also assembled a fleet of ships at Ezion-geber, which is near Eloth in Edom, on the shore of the Red Sea. 
<a id="9-27"></a> <b>27</b> And Hiram sent his servants, men who knew the sea, to serve in the fleet with Solomon&rsquo;s servants. 
<a id="9-28"></a> <b>28</b> They sailed to Ophir and imported gold from there&#x2014;420 talents&#x2014;and delivered it to Solomon.

</p>

<p>
<a id="10-1"></a> Now when the queen of Sheba heard about the fame of Solomon concerning the name of the LORD, she came to test him with difficult questions. 
<a id="10-2"></a> <b>2</b> She arrived in Jerusalem with a very large caravan&#x2014;with camels bearing spices, gold in great abundance, and precious stones.
</p>

<p>
So she came to Solomon and spoke to him all that was on her mind. 
<a id="10-3"></a> <b>3</b> And Solomon answered all her questions; nothing was too difficult for the king to explain.
</p>

<p>
<a id="10-4"></a> <b>4</b> When the queen of Sheba saw all the wisdom of Solomon, the palace he had built, 
<a id="10-5"></a> <b>5</b> the food at his table, the seating of his servants, the service and attire of his attendants and cupbearers, and the burnt offerings he presented at the house of the LORD, it took her breath away.
</p>

<p>
<a id="10-6"></a> <b>6</b> She said to the king, “The report I heard in my own country about your words and wisdom is true. 
<a id="10-7"></a> <b>7</b> But I did not believe these things until I came and saw with my own eyes. Indeed, not even half was told to me. Your wisdom and prosperity have far exceeded the report I heard. 
<a id="10-8"></a> <b>8</b> How blessed are your men! How blessed are these servants of yours who stand continually before you and hear your wisdom! 
<a id="10-9"></a> <b>9</b> Blessed be the LORD your God, who has delighted in you to set you on the throne of Israel. Because of the LORD&rsquo;s eternal love for Israel, He has made you king to carry out justice and righteousness.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="10-10"></a> <b>10</b> Then she gave the king 120 talents of gold, a great quantity of spices, and precious stones. Never again was such an abundance of spices brought in as those the queen of Sheba gave to King Solomon.
</p>

<p>
11(The fleet of Hiram that brought gold from Ophir also brought from Ophir a great cargo of almug wood and precious stones. 
<a id="10-12"></a> <b>12</b> The king made the almug wood into steps for the house of the LORD and for the king&rsquo;s palace, and into lyres and harps for the singers. Never before had such almug wood been brought in, nor has such been seen to this day.)
</p>

<p>
<a id="10-13"></a> <b>13</b> King Solomon gave the queen of Sheba all she desired&#x2014;whatever she asked&#x2014;besides what he had given her out of his royal bounty. Then she left and returned to her own country, along with her servants.

<p>
<a id="10-14"></a> <b>14</b> The weight of gold that came to Solomon each year was 666 talents, 
<a id="10-15"></a> <b>15</b> not including the revenue from the merchants, traders, and all the Arabian kings and governors of the land.
</p>

<p>
<a id="10-16"></a> <b>16</b> King Solomon made two hundred large shields of hammered gold; six hundred shekels of gold went into each shield. 
<a id="10-17"></a> <b>17</b> He also made three hundred small shields of hammered gold; three minas of gold went into each shield. And the king put them in the House of the Forest of Lebanon.
</p>

<p>
<a id="10-18"></a> <b>18</b> Additionally, the king made a great throne of ivory and overlaid it with pure gold. 
<a id="10-19"></a> <b>19</b> The throne had six steps, and its back had a rounded top. There were armrests on both sides of the seat, with a lion standing beside each armrest. 
<a id="10-20"></a> <b>20</b> Twelve lions stood on the six steps, one at either end of each step. Nothing like this had ever been made for any kingdom.
</p>

<p>
<a id="10-21"></a> <b>21</b> All King Solomon&rsquo;s drinking cups were gold, and all the utensils of the House of the Forest of Lebanon were pure gold. There was no silver, because it was accounted as nothing in the days of Solomon. 
<a id="10-22"></a> <b>22</b> For the king had the ships of Tarshish at sea with Hiram&rsquo;s fleet, and once every three years the ships of Tarshish would arrive bearing gold, silver, ivory, apes, and peacocks.
</p>

<p>
<a id="10-23"></a> <b>23</b> So King Solomon surpassed all the kings of the earth in riches and wisdom. 
<a id="10-24"></a> <b>24</b> The whole world sought an audience with Solomon to hear the wisdom that God had put in his heart. 
<a id="10-25"></a> <b>25</b> Year after year, each visitor would bring his tribute: articles of silver and gold, clothing, weapons, spices, horses, and mules.
</p>

<p>
<a id="10-26"></a> <b>26</b> Solomon accumulated 1,400 chariots and 12,000 horses, which he stationed in the chariot cities and also with him in Jerusalem. 
<a id="10-27"></a> <b>27</b> The king made silver as common in Jerusalem as stones, and cedar as abundant as sycamore in the foothills.
</p>

<p>
<a id="10-28"></a> <b>28</b> Solomon&rsquo;s horses were imported from Egypt and Kue; the royal merchants purchased them from Kue. 
<a id="10-29"></a> <b>29</b> A chariot could be imported from Egypt for six hundred shekels of silver, and a horse for a hundred and fifty. Likewise, they exported them to all the kings of the Hittites and to the kings of Aram.

<p>
<a id="11-1"></a> King Solomon, however, loved many foreign women along with the daughter of Pharaoh&#x2014;women of Moab, Ammon, Edom, and Sidon, as well as Hittite women. 
<a id="11-2"></a> <b>2</b> These women were from the nations about which the LORD had told the Israelites, “You must not intermarry with them, for surely they will turn your hearts after their gods.” Yet Solomon clung to these women in love. 
<a id="11-3"></a> <b>3</b> He had seven hundred wives of royal birth and three hundred concubines&#x2014;and his wives turned his heart away.
</p>

<p>
<a id="11-4"></a> <b>4</b> For when Solomon grew old, his wives turned his heart after other gods, and he was not wholeheartedly devoted to the LORD his God, as his father David had been. 
<a id="11-5"></a> <b>5</b> Solomon followed Ashtoreth the goddess of the Sidonians and Milcom the abomination of the Ammonites. 
<a id="11-6"></a> <b>6</b> So Solomon did evil in the sight of the LORD; unlike his father David, he did not follow the LORD completely.
</p>

<p>
<a id="11-7"></a> <b>7</b> At that time on a hill east of Jerusalem, Solomon built a high place for Chemosh the abomination of Moab and for Molech the abomination of the Ammonites.

<p>
<a id="11-11"></a> <b>11</b> Then the LORD said to Solomon, “Because you have done this and have not kept My covenant and My statutes, which I have commanded you, I will tear the kingdom away from you and give it to your servant. 
<a id="11-12"></a> <b>12</b> Nevertheless, for the sake of your father David, I will not do it during your lifetime; I will tear it out of the hand of your son.

<a id="11-14"></a> <b>14</b> Then the LORD raised up against Solomon an adversary, Hadad the Edomite, from the royal line of Edom.
</p>

<p>
<a id="11-15"></a> <b>15</b> Earlier, when David was in Edom, Joab the commander of the army had gone to bury the dead and had struck down every male in Edom. 
<a id="11-16"></a> <b>16</b> Joab and all Israel had stayed there six months, until he had killed every male in Edom. 
<a id="11-17"></a> <b>17</b> But Hadad, still just a young boy, had fled to Egypt, along with some Edomites who were servants of his father.
</p>

<p>
<a id="11-18"></a> <b>18</b> Hadad and his men set out from Midian and went to Paran. They took men from Paran with them and went to Egypt, to Pharaoh king of Egypt, who gave Hadad a house and land and provided him with food.

<p>
<a id="11-19"></a> <b>19</b> There Hadad found such great favor in the sight of Pharaoh that he gave to him in marriage the sister of Queen Tahpenes, his own wife. 
<a id="11-20"></a> <b>20</b> And the sister of Tahpenes bore Hadad a son named Genubath. Tahpenes herself weaned him in Pharaoh&rsquo;s palace, and Genubath lived there among the sons of Pharaoh.
</p>

<p>
<a id="11-21"></a> <b>21</b> When Hadad heard in Egypt that David had rested with his fathers and that Joab, the commander of the army, was dead, he said to Pharaoh, “Let me go, that I may return to my own country.”

<p>
<a id="11-22"></a> <b>22</b> But Pharaoh asked him, “What have you lacked here with me that you suddenly want to go back to your own country?”

<p>
<a id="11-26"></a> <b>26</b> Now Jeroboam son of Nebat was an Ephraimite from Zeredah whose mother was a widow named Zeruah. Jeroboam was a servant of Solomon, but he rebelled against the king, 
<a id="11-27"></a> <b>27</b> and this is the account of his rebellion against the king.
</p>

<p>
Solomon had built the supporting terraces and repaired the gap in the wall of the city of his father David. 
<a id="11-28"></a> <b>28</b> Now Jeroboam was a mighty man of valor. So when Solomon noticed that the young man was industrious, he put him in charge of the whole labor force of the house of Joseph.
</p>

<p>
<a id="11-29"></a> <b>29</b> During that time, the prophet Ahijah the Shilonite met Jeroboam on the road as he was going out of Jerusalem. Now Ahijah had wrapped himself in a new cloak, and the two of them were alone in the open field.
</p>

<p>
<a id="11-30"></a> <b>30</b> And Ahijah took hold of the new cloak he was wearing, tore it into twelve pieces, 
<a id="11-31"></a> <b>31</b> and said to Jeroboam, “Take ten pieces for yourself, for this is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says: ‘Behold, I will tear the kingdom out of the hand of Solomon, and I will give you ten tribes. 
<a id="11-32"></a> <b>32</b> But one tribe will remain for the sake of My servant David and for the sake of Jerusalem, the city I have chosen out of all the tribes of Israel.
</p>

<p>
<a id="11-33"></a> <b>33</b> For they have forsaken Me to worship Ashtoreth the goddess of the Sidonians, Chemosh the god of the Moabites, and Milcom the god of the Ammonites. They have not walked in My ways, nor done what is right in My eyes, nor kept My statutes and judgments, as Solomon&rsquo;s father David did.
</p>

<p>
<a id="11-34"></a> <b>34</b> Nevertheless, I will not take the whole kingdom out of Solomon&rsquo;s hand, because I have made him ruler all the days of his life for the sake of David My servant, whom I chose because he kept My commandments and statutes. 
<a id="11-35"></a> <b>35</b> But I will take ten tribes of the kingdom from the hand of his son and give them to you. 
<a id="11-36"></a> <b>36</b> I will give one tribe to his son, so that My servant David will always have a lamp before Me in Jerusalem, the city where I chose to put My Name. 
<a id="11-37"></a> <b>37</b> But as for you, I will take you, and you shall reign over all that your heart desires, and you will be king over Israel.
</p>

<p>
<a id="11-38"></a> <b>38</b> If you listen to all that I command you, walk in My ways, and do what is right in My sight in order to keep My statutes and commandments as My servant David did, then I will be with you.

<a id="12-7"></a> <b>7</b> They replied, “If you will be a servant to these people and serve them this day, and if you will respond by speaking kind words to them, they will be your servants forever.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="12-8"></a> <b>8</b> But Rehoboam rejected the advice of the elders; instead, he consulted the young men who had grown up with him and served him. 
<a id="12-9"></a> <b>9</b> He asked them, “What message do you advise that we send back to these people who have spoken to me, saying, ‘Lighten the yoke your father put on us&rsquo;?”
</p>

<p>
<a id="12-10"></a> <b>10</b> The young men who had grown up with him replied, “This is how you should answer these people who said to you, ‘Your father made our yoke heavy, but you should make it lighter.&rsquo; This is what you should tell them: ‘My little finger is thicker than my father&rsquo;s waist! 
<a id="12-11"></a> <b>11</b> Whereas my father burdened you with a heavy yoke, I will add to your yoke. Whereas my father scourged you with whips, I will scourge you with scorpions.&rsquo; ”

<p>
<a id="12-12"></a> <b>12</b> After three days, Jeroboam and all the people returned to Rehoboam, since the king had said, “Come back to me on the third day.” 
<a id="12-13"></a> <b>13</b> And the king answered the people harshly. He rejected the advice of the elders 
<a id="12-14"></a> <b>14</b> and spoke to them as the young men had advised, saying, “Whereas my father made your yoke heavy, I will add to your yoke. Whereas my father scourged you with whips, I will scourge you with scorpions.”

<p>
<a id="12-21"></a> <b>21</b> And when Rehoboam arrived in Jerusalem, he mobilized the whole house of Judah and the tribe of Benjamin&#x2014;180,000 chosen warriors&#x2014;to fight against the house of Israel and restore the kingdom to Rehoboam son of Solomon.
</p>

<p>
<a id="12-22"></a> <b>22</b> But the word of God came to Shemaiah the man of God:
<a id="12-23"></a> <b>23</b> “Tell Rehoboam son of Solomon king of Judah, all the house of Judah and Benjamin, and the rest of the people 
<a id="12-24"></a> <b>24</b> that this is what the LORD says: ‘You are not to go up and fight against your brothers, the Israelites. Each of you must return home, for this word is from Me.&rsquo; ”

<a id="12-25"></a> <b>25</b> Then Jeroboam built Shechem in the hill country of Ephraim and lived there. And from there he went out and built Penuel.
</p>

<p>
<a id="12-26"></a> <b>26</b> Jeroboam said in his heart, “Now the kingdom might revert to the house of David. 
<a id="12-27"></a> <b>27</b> If these people go up to offer sacrifices in the house of the LORD at Jerusalem, their hearts will return to their lord, Rehoboam king of Judah; then they will kill me and return to Rehoboam king of Judah.”

<p>
<a id="12-29"></a> <b>29</b> One calf he set up in Bethel, and the other in Dan. 
<a id="12-30"></a> <b>30</b> And this thing became a sin; the people walked as far as Dan to worship before one of the calves.
</p>

<p>
<a id="12-31"></a> <b>31</b> Jeroboam also built shrines on the high places and appointed from every class of people priests who were not Levites. 
<a id="12-32"></a> <b>32</b> And Jeroboam ordained a feast on the fifteenth day of the eighth month, like the feast that was in Judah, and he offered sacrifices on the altar; he made this offering in Bethel to sacrifice to the calves he had set up, and he installed priests in Bethel for the high places he had set up.

<p>
<a id="13-1"></a> Suddenly, as Jeroboam was standing beside the altar to burn incense, there came a man of God from Judah to Bethel by the word of the LORD. 
<a id="13-2"></a> <b>2</b> And he cried out against the altar by the word of the LORD, “O altar, O altar, this is what the LORD says: ‘A son named Josiah will be born to the house of David, and upon you he will sacrifice the priests of the high places who burn incense upon you, and human bones will be burned upon you.&rsquo; ”
</p>

<p>
<a id="13-3"></a> <b>3</b> That day the man of God gave a sign, saying, “The LORD has spoken this sign: ‘Surely the altar will be split apart, and the ashes upon it will be poured out.&rsquo; ”
</p>

<p>
<a id="13-4"></a> <b>4</b> Now when King Jeroboam, who was at the altar in Bethel, heard the word that the man of God had cried out against it, he stretched out his hand and said, “Seize him!” But the hand he stretched out toward him withered, so that he could not pull it back. 
<a id="13-5"></a> <b>5</b> And the altar was split apart, and the ashes poured out, according to the sign that the man of God had given by the word of the LORD.
</p>

<p>
<a id="13-6"></a> <b>6</b> Then the king responded to the man of God, “Intercede with the LORD your God and pray that my hand may be restored.”
</p>

<p>
So the man of God interceded with the LORD, and the king&rsquo;s hand was restored to him as it was before.
</p>

<p>
<a id="13-7"></a> <b>7</b> Then the king said to the man of God, “Come home with me and refresh yourself, and I will give you a reward.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="13-8"></a> <b>8</b> But the man of God replied, “If you were to give me half your possessions, I still would not go with you, nor would I eat bread or drink water in this place. 
<a id="13-9"></a> <b>9</b> For this is what I was commanded by the word of the LORD: ‘You must not eat bread or drink water or return by the way you came.&rsquo; ”

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org014e66a">
<p>
<a id="13-11"></a> <b>11</b> Now a certain old prophet was living in Bethel, and his sons came and told him all the deeds that the man of God had done that day in Bethel. They also told their father the words that the man had spoken to the king.
</p>

<p>
<a id="13-12"></a> <b>12</b> “Which way did he go?” their father asked.
</p>

<p>
And his sons showed him the way taken by the man of God, who had come from Judah. 
<a id="13-13"></a> <b>13</b> So the prophet said to his sons, “Saddle the donkey for me.”
</p>

<p>
Then they saddled the donkey for him, and he mounted it 
<a id="13-14"></a> <b>14</b> and went after the man of God. He found him sitting under an oak tree and asked, “Are you the man of God who came from Judah?”
</p>

<p>
“I am,” he replied.
</p>

<p>
<a id="13-15"></a> <b>15</b> So the prophet said to the man of God, “Come home with me and eat some bread.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="13-16"></a> <b>16</b> But the man replied, “I cannot return with you or eat bread or drink water with you in this place. 
<a id="13-17"></a> <b>17</b> For I have been told by the word of the LORD: ‘You must not eat bread or drink water there or return by the way you came.&rsquo; ”
</p>

<p>
<a id="13-18"></a> <b>18</b> Then the prophet replied, “I too am a prophet like you, and an angel spoke to me by the word of the LORD, saying, ‘Bring him back with you to your house, so that he may eat bread and drink water.&rsquo; ”
</p>

<p>
The old prophet was lying to him, 
<a id="13-19"></a> <b>19</b> but the man of God went back with him, ate bread in his house, and drank water.
</p>

<p>
<a id="13-20"></a> <b>20</b> While they were sitting at the table, the word of the LORD came to the prophet who had brought him back, 
<a id="13-21"></a> <b>21</b> and the prophet cried out to the man of God who had come from Judah, “This is what the LORD says: ‘Because you have defied the word of the LORD and have not kept the commandment that the LORD your God gave you, 
<a id="13-22"></a> <b>22</b> but you went back and ate bread and drank water in the place where He told you not to do so, your body shall never reach the tomb of your fathers.&rsquo; ”
</p>

<p>
<a id="13-23"></a> <b>23</b> And after the man of God had finished eating and drinking, the old prophet who had brought him back saddled the donkey for him. 
<a id="13-24"></a> <b>24</b> As he went on his way, a lion met him on the road and killed him, and his body was left lying in the road, with the donkey and the lion standing beside it.
</p>

<p>
<a id="13-25"></a> <b>25</b> And there were men passing by who saw the body lying in the road with the lion standing beside it, and they went and reported this in the city where the old prophet lived.
</p>

<p>
<a id="13-26"></a> <b>26</b> When the prophet who had brought him back from his journey heard this, he said, “It is the man of God who disobeyed the command of the LORD. Therefore the LORD has delivered him to the lion, and it has mauled him and killed him, according to the word that the LORD had spoken to him.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="13-27"></a> <b>27</b> Then the old prophet instructed his sons, “Saddle the donkey for me.” So they saddled it, 
<a id="13-28"></a> <b>28</b> and he went and found the body lying in the road, with the donkey and the lion standing beside it. The lion had not eaten the body or mauled the donkey. 
<a id="13-29"></a> <b>29</b> So the old prophet lifted up the body of the man of God, laid it on the donkey, and brought it back to his own city to mourn for him and bury him. 
<a id="13-30"></a> <b>30</b> Then he laid the body in his own tomb, and they lamented over him, “Oh, my brother!”
</p>

<p>
<a id="13-31"></a> <b>31</b> After he had buried him, the prophet said to his sons, “When I die, you must bury me in the tomb where the man of God is buried. Lay my bones beside his bones, 
<a id="13-32"></a> <b>32</b> for the message that he cried out by the word of the LORD against the altar in Bethel and against all the shrines on the high places in the cities of Samaria will surely come to pass.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="13-33"></a> <b>33</b> Even after these events, Jeroboam did not repent of his evil ways, but again he appointed priests for the high places from every class of people. He ordained anyone who desired to be a priest of the high places. 
<a id="13-34"></a> <b>34</b> And this was the sin of the house of Jeroboam that led to its extermination and destruction from the face of the earth.

<p>
<a id="14-1"></a> At that time Abijah son of Jeroboam became ill, 
<a id="14-2"></a> <b>2</b> and Jeroboam said to his wife, “Now get up, disguise yourself so they will not recognize you as my wife, and go to Shiloh. For Ahijah the prophet is there; it was he who spoke about my kingship over this people. 
<a id="14-3"></a> <b>3</b> Take with you ten loaves of bread, some cakes, and a jar of honey, and go to him. He will tell you what will become of the boy.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="14-4"></a> <b>4</b> Jeroboam&rsquo;s wife did as instructed; she arose and went to Shiloh and arrived at Ahijah&rsquo;s house. Now Ahijah could not see, for his eyes were dim because of his age. 
<a id="14-5"></a> <b>5</b> But the LORD had said to Ahijah, “Behold, the wife of Jeroboam is coming to ask you about her son, for he is ill. You are to say such and such to her, because when she arrives, she will be disguised.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="14-6"></a> <b>6</b> So when Ahijah heard the sound of her feet entering the door, he said, “Come in, wife of Jeroboam! Why are you disguised? For I have been sent to you with bad news. 
<a id="14-7"></a> <b>7</b> Go, tell Jeroboam that this is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says: ‘I raised you up from among the people and appointed you ruler over My people Israel. 
<a id="14-8"></a> <b>8</b> I tore the kingdom away from the house of David and gave it to you. But you were not like My servant David, who kept My commandments and followed Me with all his heart, doing only what was right in My eyes.
</p>

<p>
<a id="14-9"></a> <b>9</b> You have done more evil than all who came before you. You have proceeded to make for yourself other gods and molten images to provoke Me, and you have flung Me behind your back. 
<a id="14-10"></a> <b>10</b> Because of all this, behold, I am bringing disaster on the house of Jeroboam:
</p>

<p>
I will cut off from Jeroboam every male,

<p>
both slave and free,
</p>

<p>
in Israel;
</p>

<p>
I will burn up the house of Jeroboam
</p>

<p>
as one burns up dung until it is gone!
</p>

<p>
<a id="14-11"></a> <b>11</b> Anyone belonging to Jeroboam who dies in the city
</p>

<p>
will be eaten by dogs,
</p>

<p>
and anyone who dies in the field
</p>

<p>
will be eaten by the birds of the air.&rsquo;

<p>
For the LORD has spoken.
</p>

<p>
<a id="14-12"></a> <b>12</b> As for you, get up and go home. When your feet enter the city, the child will die. 
<a id="14-13"></a> <b>13</b> All Israel will mourn for him and bury him. For this is the only one belonging to Jeroboam who will receive a proper burial, because only in him has the LORD, the God of Israel, found any good in the house of Jeroboam.
</p>

<p>
<a id="14-14"></a> <b>14</b> Moreover, the LORD will raise up for Himself a king over Israel who will cut off the house of Jeroboam. This is the day&#x2014;yes, even today! 
<a id="14-15"></a> <b>15</b> For the LORD will strike Israel as a reed is shaken in the water. He will uproot Israel from this good land that He gave their fathers, and He will scatter them beyond the Euphrates, because they have made their Asherah poles, provoking the LORD to anger. 
<a id="14-16"></a> <b>16</b> So He will give Israel over on account of the sins Jeroboam has committed and has caused Israel to commit.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="14-17"></a> <b>17</b> Then Jeroboam&rsquo;s wife got up and departed for Tirzah, and as soon as she stepped over the threshold of the house, the boy died.

<p>
<a id="17-10"></a> <b>10</b> So Elijah got up and went to Zarephath. When he arrived at the city gate, there was a widow gathering sticks. Elijah called to her and said, “Please bring me a little water in a cup, so that I may drink.” 
<a id="17-11"></a> <b>11</b> And as she was going to get it, he called to her and said, “Please bring me a piece of bread.”

<a id="17-13"></a> <b>13</b> “Do not be afraid,” Elijah said to her. “Go and do as you have said. But first make me a small cake of bread from what you have, and bring it out to me. Afterward, make some for yourself and your son,

<p>
<a id="18-2"></a> <b>2</b> So Elijah went to present himself to Ahab. The famine was severe in Samaria, 
<a id="18-3"></a> <b>3</b> and Ahab summoned Obadiah, who was in charge of the palace.
</p>

<p>
(Now Obadiah greatly feared the LORD, 
<a id="18-4"></a> <b>4</b> for when Jezebel had slaughtered the prophets of the LORD, Obadiah had taken a hundred prophets and hidden them, fifty men per cave, providing them with food and water.)
</p>

<p>
<a id="18-5"></a> <b>5</b> Then Ahab said to Obadiah, “Go throughout the land to every spring and every valley. Perhaps we will find grass to keep the horses and mules alive so that we will not have to destroy any livestock.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="18-6"></a> <b>6</b> So they divided the land to explore. Ahab went one way by himself, and Obadiah went the other way by himself.
</p>

<p>
<a id="18-7"></a> <b>7</b> Now as Obadiah went on his way, Elijah suddenly met him. When Obadiah recognized him, he fell facedown and said, “Is it you, my lord Elijah?”
</p>

<p>
<a id="18-8"></a> <b>8</b> “It is I,” he answered. “Go tell your master, ‘Elijah is here!&rsquo; ”
</p>

<p>
<a id="18-9"></a> <b>9</b> But Obadiah replied, “How have I sinned, that you are handing your servant over to Ahab to put me to death? 
<a id="18-10"></a> <b>10</b> As surely as the LORD your God lives, there is no nation or kingdom where my lord has not sent someone to search for you. When they said, ‘He is not here,&rsquo; he made that kingdom or nation swear that they had not found you. 
<a id="18-11"></a> <b>11</b> And now you say, ‘Go tell your master that Elijah is here!&rsquo;
</p>

<p>
<a id="18-12"></a> <b>12</b> I do not know where the Spirit of the LORD may carry you off when I leave you. Then when I go and tell Ahab and he does not find you, he will kill me. But I, your servant, have feared the LORD from my youth. 
<a id="18-13"></a> <b>13</b> Was it not reported to my lord what I did when Jezebel slaughtered the prophets of the LORD? I hid a hundred prophets of the LORD, fifty men per cave, and I provided them with food and water.

</p>

<p>
<a id="18-18"></a> <b>18</b> “I have not troubled Israel,” Elijah replied, “but you and your father&rsquo;s house have, for you have forsaken the commandments of the LORD and have followed the Baals. 
<a id="18-19"></a> <b>19</b> Now summon all Israel to meet me on Mount Carmel, along with the four hundred and fifty prophets of Baal and the four hundred prophets of Asherah who eat at Jezebel&rsquo;s table.”

<p>
<a id="18-20"></a> <b>20</b> So Ahab summoned all the Israelites and assembled the prophets on Mount Carmel. 
<a id="18-21"></a> <b>21</b> Then Elijah approached all the people and said, “How long will you waver between two opinions? If the LORD is God, follow Him. But if Baal is God, follow him.”
</p>

<p>
But the people did not answer a word.
</p>

<p>
<a id="18-22"></a> <b>22</b> Then Elijah said to the people, “I am the only remaining prophet of the LORD, but Baal has four hundred and fifty prophets. 
<a id="18-23"></a> <b>23</b> Get two bulls for us. Let the prophets of Baal choose one bull for themselves, cut it into pieces, and place it on the wood but not light the fire. And I will prepare the other bull and place it on the wood but not light the fire.

</p>

<p>
And all the people answered, “What you say is good.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="18-25"></a> <b>25</b> Then Elijah said to the prophets of Baal, “Since you are so numerous, choose for yourselves one bull and prepare it first. Then call on the name of your god, but do not light the fire.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="18-26"></a> <b>26</b> And they took the bull that was given them, prepared it, and called on the name of Baal from morning until noon, shouting, “O Baal, answer us!”
</p>

<p>
But there was no sound, and no one answered as they leaped around the altar they had made.
</p>

<p>
<a id="18-27"></a> <b>27</b> At noon Elijah began to taunt them, saying, “Shout louder, for he is a god! Perhaps he is deep in thought, or occupied, or on a journey. Perhaps he is sleeping and must be awakened!”
</p>

<p>
<a id="18-28"></a> <b>28</b> So they shouted louder and cut themselves with knives and lances, as was their custom, until the blood gushed over them.

<a id="18-30"></a> <b>30</b> Then Elijah said to all the people, “Come near to me.” So all the people approached him, and he repaired the altar of the LORD that had been torn down.
</p>

<p>
<a id="18-31"></a> <b>31</b> And Elijah took twelve stones, one for each tribe of the sons of Jacob, to whom the word of the LORD had come and said, “Israel shall be your name.” 
<a id="18-32"></a> <b>32</b> And with the stones, Elijah built an altar in the name of the LORD. Then he dug a trench around the altar large enough to hold two seahs of seed.
</p>

<p>
<a id="18-33"></a> <b>33</b> Next, he arranged the wood, cut up the bull, placed it on the wood, 
<a id="18-34"></a> <b>34</b> and said, “Fill four waterpots and pour the water on the offering and on the wood.”
</p>

<p>
“Do it a second time,” he said, and they did it a second time.
</p>

<p>
“Do it a third time,” he said, and they did it a third time.

<a id="18-37"></a> <b>37</b> Answer me, O LORD! Answer me, so that this people will know that You, the LORD, are God, and that You have turned their hearts back again.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="18-38"></a> <b>38</b> Then the fire of the LORD fell and consumed the sacrifice, the wood, the stones, and the dust, and it licked up the water in the trench.
</p>

<p>
<a id="18-39"></a> <b>39</b> When all the people saw this, they fell facedown and said, “The LORD, He is God! The LORD, He is God!”

<p>
So the messengers departed and relayed the message to Ben-hadad.

<a id="20-11"></a> <b>11</b> And the king of Israel replied, “Tell him: ‘The one putting on his armor should not boast like one taking it off.&rsquo; ”

“Who will start the battle?” asked Ahab.

<p>
“You will,” answered the prophet.

<p>
<a id="20-15"></a> <b>15</b> So Ahab assembled the young officers of the district governors, and there were 232 men. And after them, he assembled the rest of the Israelite troops, 7,000 in all.

Now Ben-hadad had sent out scouts, who reported to him, “Men are marching out of Samaria.”
</p>

The Israelites camped before them like two small flocks of goats, while the Arameans covered the countryside.

<a id="22-2"></a> <b>2</b> However, in the third year, Jehoshaphat king of Judah went down to visit the king of Israel, 
<a id="22-3"></a> <b>3</b> who said to his servants, “Do you not know that Ramoth-gilead is ours, but we have failed to take it from the hand of the king of Aram?”
</p>

<p>
<a id="22-4"></a> <b>4</b> So he asked Jehoshaphat, “Will you go with me to fight against Ramoth-gilead?”
</p>

<p>
Jehoshaphat answered the king of Israel, “I am like you, my people are your people, and my horses are your horses.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="22-5"></a> <b>5</b> But Jehoshaphat also said to the king of Israel, “Please inquire first for the word of the LORD.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="22-6"></a> <b>6</b> So the king of Israel assembled the prophets, about four hundred men, and asked them, “Should I go to war against Ramoth-gilead, or should I refrain?”
</p>

<p>
“Go up,” they replied, “and the Lord will deliver it into the hand of the king.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="22-7"></a> <b>7</b> But Jehoshaphat asked, “Is there not still a prophet of the LORD here of whom we can inquire?”
</p>

<p>
<a id="22-8"></a> <b>8</b> The king of Israel answered, “There is still one man who can ask the LORD, but I hate him because he never prophesies anything good for me, but only bad. He is Micaiah son of Imlah.”
</p>

<p>
“The king should not say that!” Jehoshaphat replied.
</p>

<p>
<a id="22-9"></a> <b>9</b> So the king of Israel called one of his officials and said, “Bring Micaiah son of Imlah at once.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="22-10"></a> <b>10</b> Dressed in royal attire, the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat king of Judah were sitting on their thrones at the threshing floor by the entrance of the gate of Samaria, with all the prophets prophesying before them.
</p>

<p>
<a id="22-11"></a> Now Zedekiah son of Chenaanah had made for himself iron horns and declared, “This is what the LORD says: ‘With these you shall gore the Arameans until they are finished off.&rsquo; ”
</p>

<p>
<a id="22-12"></a> <b>12</b> And all the prophets were prophesying the same, saying, “Go up to Ramoth-gilead and prosper, for the LORD will deliver it into the hand of the king.”

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org1a7ccef">
<p>
<a id="22-13"></a> <b>13</b> Then the messenger who had gone to call Micaiah instructed him, “Behold now, with one accord the words of the prophets are favorable to the king. So please let your words be like theirs, and speak favorably.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="22-14"></a> <b>14</b> But Micaiah said, “As surely as the LORD lives, I will speak whatever the LORD tells me.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="22-15"></a> <b>15</b> When Micaiah arrived, the king asked him, “Micaiah, should we go to war against Ramoth-gilead, or should we refrain?”
</p>

<p>
“Go up and triumph,” Micaiah replied, “for the LORD will give it into the hand of the king.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="22-16"></a> <b>16</b> But the king said to him, “How many times must I make you swear not to tell me anything but the truth in the name of the LORD?”
</p>

<p>
<a id="22-17"></a> <b>17</b> So Micaiah declared:
</p>

<p>
“I saw all Israel scattered on the hills
</p>

<p>
like sheep without a shepherd.
</p>

<p>
And the LORD said, ‘These people have no master;
</p>

<p>
let each one return home in peace.&rsquo; ”
</p>

<p>
<a id="22-18"></a> <b>18</b> Then the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, “Did I not tell you that he never prophesies good for me, but only bad?”
</p>

<p>
<a id="22-19"></a> <b>19</b> Micaiah continued, “Therefore hear the word of the LORD: I saw the LORD sitting on His throne, and all the host of heaven standing by Him on His right and on His left.
</p>

<p>
<a id="22-20"></a> <b>20</b> And the LORD said, ‘Who will entice Ahab to march up and fall at Ramoth-gilead?&rsquo;
</p>

<p>
And one suggested this, and another that.
</p>

<p>
<a id="22-21"></a> <b>21</b> Then a spirit came forward, stood before the LORD, and said, ‘I will entice him.&rsquo;
</p>

<p>
‘By what means?&rsquo; asked the LORD.
</p>

<p>
<a id="22-22"></a> <b>22</b> And he replied, ‘I will go out and be a lying spirit in the mouths of all his prophets.&rsquo;
</p>

<p>
‘You will surely entice him and prevail,&rsquo; said the LORD. ‘Go and do it.&rsquo;
</p>

<p>
<a id="22-23"></a> <b>23</b> So you see, the LORD has put a lying spirit in the mouths of all these prophets of yours, and the LORD has pronounced disaster against you.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="22-24"></a> <b>24</b> Then Zedekiah son of Chenaanah went up, struck Micaiah in the face, and demanded, “Which way did the Spirit of the LORD go when He departed from me to speak with you?”
</p>

<p>
<a id="22-25"></a> <b>25</b> Micaiah replied, “You will soon see, on that day when you go and hide in an inner room.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="22-26"></a> <b>26</b> And the king of Israel declared, “Take Micaiah and return him to Amon the governor of the city and to Joash the king&rsquo;s son, 
<a id="22-27"></a> <b>27</b> and tell them that this is what the king says: ‘Put this man in prison and feed him only bread and water until I return safely.&rsquo; ”
</p>

<p>
<a id="22-28"></a> <b>28</b> But Micaiah replied, “If you ever return safely, the LORD has not spoken through me.” Then he added, “Take heed, all you people!”

<p>
<a id="22-29"></a> <b>29</b> So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat king of Judah went up to Ramoth-gilead. 
<a id="22-30"></a> <b>30</b> And the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, “I will disguise myself and go into battle, but you wear your royal robes.” So the king of Israel disguised himself and went into battle.
</p>

<p>
<a id="22-31"></a> <b>31</b> Now the king of Aram had ordered his thirty-two chariot commanders, “Do not fight with anyone, small or great, except the king of Israel.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="22-32"></a> <b>32</b> When the chariot commanders saw Jehoshaphat, they said, “Surely this is the king of Israel!” So they turned to fight against him, but Jehoshaphat cried out. 
<a id="22-33"></a> <b>33</b> And when the chariot commanders saw that he was not the king of Israel, they turned back from pursuing him.
</p>

<p>
<a id="22-34"></a> <b>34</b> However, a certain man drew his bow without taking special aim, and he struck the king of Israel between the joints of his armor. So the king said to his charioteer, “Turn around and take me out of the battle, for I am badly wounded!”
</p>

<p>
<a id="22-35"></a> <b>35</b> The battle raged throughout that day, and the king was propped up in his chariot facing the Arameans. And the blood from his wound ran out onto the floor of the chariot, and that evening he died. 
<a id="22-36"></a> <b>36</b> As the sun was setting, the cry rang out in the army:
</p>

<p>
“Every man to his own city,
</p>

<p>
and every man to his own land!”
</p>

<p>
<a id="22-37"></a> <b>37</b> So the king died and was brought to Samaria, where they buried him. 
<a id="22-38"></a> <b>38</b> And the chariot was washed at the pool of Samaria where the prostitutes bathed, and the dogs licked up Ahab&rsquo;s blood, according to the word that the LORD had spoken.

The high places, however, were not removed; the people still sacrificed and burned incense on the high places.

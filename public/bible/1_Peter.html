<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org1c042b8">
<p>
<a id="1-3"></a> <b>3</b> Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ! By His great mercy He has given us new birth into a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead, 
<a id="1-4"></a> <b>4</b> and into an inheritance that is imperishable, undefiled, and unfading, reserved in heaven for you, 
<a id="1-5"></a> <b>5</b> who through faith are shielded by God&rsquo;s power for the salvation that is ready to be revealed in the last time.
</p>

<p>
<a id="1-6"></a> <b>6</b> In this you greatly rejoice, though now for a little while you may have had to suffer grief in various trials 
<a id="1-7"></a> <b>7</b> so that the proven character of your faith&#x2014;more precious than gold, which perishes even though refined by fire&#x2014;may result in praise, glory, and honor at the revelation of Jesus Christ.
</p>

<p>
<a id="1-8"></a> <b>8</b> Though you have not seen Him, you love Him; and though you do not see Him now, you believe in Him and rejoice with an inexpressible and glorious joy, 
<a id="1-9"></a> <b>9</b> now that you are receiving the goal of your faith, the salvation of your souls.
</p>

<p>
<a id="1-10"></a> <b>10</b> Concerning this salvation, the prophets who foretold the grace to come to you searched and investigated carefully, 
<a id="1-11"></a> <b>11</b> trying to determine the time and setting to which the Spirit of Christ in them was pointing when He predicted the sufferings of Christ and the glories to follow.
</p>

<p>
<a id="1-12"></a> <b>12</b> It was revealed to them that they were not serving themselves, but you, when they foretold the things now announced by those who preached the gospel to you by the Holy Spirit sent from heaven. Even angels long to look into these things.

<a id="1-13"></a> <b>13</b> Therefore prepare your minds for action. Be sober-minded. Set your hope fully on the grace to be given you at the revelation of Jesus Christ. 
<a id="1-14"></a> <b>14</b> As obedient children, do not conform to the passions of your former ignorance. 
<a id="1-15"></a> <b>15</b> But just as He who called you is holy, so be holy in all you do, 
<a id="1-16"></a> <b>16</b> for it is written: “Be holy, because I am holy.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="1-17"></a> <b>17</b> Since you call on a Father who judges each one&rsquo;s work impartially, conduct yourselves in reverent fear during your stay as foreigners. 
<a id="1-18"></a> <b>18</b> For you know that it was not with perishable things such as silver or gold that you were redeemed from the empty way of life you inherited from your forefathers, 
<a id="1-19"></a> <b>19</b> but with the precious blood of Christ, a lamb without blemish or spot. 
<a id="1-20"></a> <b>20</b> He was known before the foundation of the world, but was revealed in the last times for your sake.
</p>

<p>

<a id="2-5"></a> <b>5</b> you also, like living stones, are being built into a spiritual house to be a holy priesthood, offering spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God through Jesus Christ.

<p>
<a id="2-9"></a> <b>9</b> But you are a chosen people, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a people for God&rsquo;s own possession, to proclaim the virtues of Him who called you out of darkness into His marvelous light. 
<a id="2-10"></a> <b>10</b> Once you were not a people, but now you are the people of God; once you had not received mercy, but now you have received mercy.
</p>

<p>
<a id="2-11"></a> <b>11</b> Beloved, I urge you, as foreigners and exiles, to abstain from the desires of the flesh, which war against your soul. 
<a id="2-12"></a> <b>12</b> Conduct yourselves with such honor among the Gentiles that, though they slander you as evildoers, they may see your good deeds and glorify God on the day He visits us.

<a id="2-15"></a> <b>15</b> For it is God&rsquo;s will that by doing good you should silence the ignorance of foolish men.
</p>

<p>
<a id="2-16"></a> <b>16</b> Live in freedom, but do not use your freedom as a cover-up for evil; live as servants of God. 
<a id="2-17"></a> <b>17</b> Treat everyone with high regard: Love the brotherhood of believers, fear God, honor the king.
</p>

<p>
<a id="2-18"></a> <b>18</b> Servants, submit yourselves to your masters with all respect, not only to those who are good and gentle, but even to those who are unreasonable. 
<a id="2-19"></a> <b>19</b> For if anyone endures the pain of unjust suffering because he is conscious of God, this is to be commended.

<a id="3-15"></a> <b>15</b> But in your hearts sanctify Christ as Lord. Always be prepared to give a defense to everyone who asks you the reason for the hope that is in you. But respond with gentleness and respect,

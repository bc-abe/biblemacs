<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org1a80c9b">
<p>
<a id="1-3"></a> <b>3</b> As I urged you on my departure to Macedonia, you should stay on at Ephesus to instruct certain men not to teach false doctrines 
<a id="1-4"></a> <b>4</b> or devote themselves to myths and endless genealogies, which promote speculation rather than the stewardship of God&rsquo;s work, which is by faith.
</p>

<p>
<a id="1-5"></a> <b>5</b> The goal of our instruction is the love that comes from a pure heart, a clear conscience, and a sincere faith. 
<a id="1-6"></a> <b>6</b> Some have strayed from these ways and turned aside to empty talk. 
<a id="1-7"></a> <b>7</b> They want to be teachers of the law, but they do not understand what they are saying or that which they so confidently assert.
</p>

<p>
<a id="1-8"></a> <b>8</b> Now we know that the law is good, if one uses it legitimately. 
<a id="1-9"></a> <b>9</b> We realize that law is not enacted for the righteous, but for the lawless and rebellious, for the ungodly and sinful, for the unholy and profane, for killers of father or mother, for murderers, 
<a id="1-10"></a> <b>10</b> for the sexually immoral, for homosexuals, for slave traders and liars and perjurers, and for anyone else who is averse to sound teaching 
<a id="1-11"></a> <b>11</b> that agrees with the glorious gospel of the blessed God, with which I have been entrusted.

<p>
<a id="1-12"></a> <b>12</b> I thank Christ Jesus our Lord, who has strengthened me, that He considered me faithful and appointed me to service. 
<a id="1-13"></a> <b>13</b> I was formerly a blasphemer, a persecutor, and a violent man; yet because I had acted in ignorance and unbelief, I was shown mercy. 
<a id="1-14"></a> <b>14</b> And the grace of our Lord overflowed to me, along with the faith and love that are in Christ Jesus.
</p>

<p>
<a id="1-15"></a> <b>15</b> This is a trustworthy saying, worthy of full acceptance: Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners, of whom I am the worst. 
<a id="1-16"></a> <b>16</b> But for this very reason I was shown mercy, so that in me, the worst of sinners, Christ Jesus might display His perfect patience as an example to those who would believe in Him for eternal life. 
<a id="1-17"></a> <b>17</b> Now to the King eternal, immortal, and invisible, the only God, be honor and glory forever and ever. Amen.

<a id="1-18"></a> <b>18</b> Timothy, my child, I entrust you with this command in keeping with the previous prophecies about you, so that by them you may fight the good fight, 
<a id="1-19"></a> <b>19</b> holding on to faith and a good conscience, which some have rejected and thereby shipwrecked their faith. 
<a id="1-20"></a> <b>20</b> Among them are Hymenaeus and Alexander, whom I have handed over to Satan to be taught not to blaspheme.

<p>
<a id="2-5"></a> <b>5</b> For there is one God, and there is one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus,

<p>
<a id="2-9"></a> <b>9</b> Likewise, I want the women to adorn themselves with respectable apparel, with modesty, and with self-control, not with braided hair or gold or pearls or expensive clothes,

</p>

<p>
<a id="2-11"></a> <b>11</b> A woman must learn in quietness and full submissiveness. 
<a id="2-12"></a> <b>12</b> I do not permit a woman to teach or to exercise authority over a man; she is to remain quiet. 
<a id="2-13"></a> <b>13</b> For Adam was formed first, and then Eve. 
<a id="2-14"></a> <b>14</b> And it was not Adam who was deceived, but the woman who was deceived and fell into transgression. 
<a id="2-15"></a> <b>15</b> Women, however, will be saved through childbearing, if they continue in faith, love, and holiness, with self-control.

<p>
<a id="3-1"></a> This is a trustworthy saying: If anyone aspires to be an overseer, he desires a noble task.

</p>

<p>
<a id="3-4"></a> <b>4</b> An overseer must manage his own household well and keep his children under control, with complete dignity. 
<a id="3-5"></a> <b>5</b> For if someone does not know how to manage his own household, how can he care for the church of God?

<p>
<a id="5-3"></a> <b>3</b> Honor the widows who are truly widows. 
<a id="5-4"></a> <b>4</b> But if a widow has children or grandchildren, they must first learn to show godliness to their own family and repay their parents, for this is pleasing in the sight of God.
</p>

<p>
<a id="5-5"></a> <b>5</b> The widow who is truly in need and left all alone puts her hope in God and continues night and day in her petitions and prayers. 
<a id="5-6"></a> <b>6</b> But she who lives for pleasure is dead even while she is still alive.
</p>

<p>
<a id="5-7"></a> <b>7</b> Give these instructions to the believers, so that they will be above reproach. 
<a id="5-8"></a> <b>8</b> If anyone does not provide for his own, and especially his own household, he has denied the faith and is worse than an unbeliever.
</p>

<p>
<a id="5-9"></a> <b>9</b> A widow should be enrolled if she is at least sixty years old, the wife of one man, 
<a id="5-10"></a> <b>10</b> and well known for good deeds such as bringing up children, entertaining strangers, washing the feet of the saints, imparting relief to the afflicted, and devoting herself to every good work.
</p>

<p>
<a id="5-11"></a> <b>11</b> But refuse to enroll younger widows. For when their passions draw them away from Christ, they will want to marry, 
<a id="5-12"></a> <b>12</b> and thus will incur judgment because they are setting aside their first faith. 
<a id="5-13"></a> <b>13</b> At the same time they will also learn to be idle, going from house to house and being not only idle, but also gossips and busybodies, discussing things they should not mention.

<a id="5-14"></a> <b>14</b> So I advise the younger widows to marry, have children, and manage their households, denying the adversary occasion for slander.

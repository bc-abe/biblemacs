<p>
<a id="1-1"></a> Now Solomon son of David established himself securely over his kingdom, and the LORD his God was with him and highly exalted him.
</p>

<p>
<a id="1-2"></a> <b>2</b> Then Solomon spoke to all Israel, to the commanders of thousands and of hundreds, to the judges, and to every leader in all Israel&#x2014;the heads of the families. 
<a id="1-3"></a> <b>3</b> And Solomon and the whole assembly went to the high place at Gibeon because it was the location of God&rsquo;s Tent of Meeting, which Moses the servant of the LORD had made in the wilderness.
</p>

<p>
<a id="1-4"></a> <b>4</b> Now David had brought the ark of God from Kiriath-jearim to the place he had prepared for it, because he had pitched a tent for it in Jerusalem. 
<a id="1-5"></a> <b>5</b> But the bronze altar made by Bezalel son of Uri, the son of Hur, was in Gibeon before the tabernacle of the LORD. So Solomon and the assembly inquired of Him there.
</p>

<p>
<a id="1-6"></a> <b>6</b> Solomon offered sacrifices there before the LORD on the bronze altar in the Tent of Meeting, where he offered a thousand burnt offerings.
</p>

<p>
<a id="1-7"></a> <b>7</b> That night God appeared to Solomon and said, “Ask, and I will give it to you!”
</p>

<p>
<a id="1-8"></a> <b>8</b> Solomon replied to God: “You have shown much loving devotion to my father David, and You have made me king in his place. 
<a id="1-9"></a> <b>9</b> Now, O LORD God, let Your promise to my father David be fulfilled. For You have made me king over a people as numerous as the dust of the earth. 
<a id="1-10"></a> <b>10</b> Now grant me wisdom and knowledge, so that I may lead this people. For who is able to govern this great people of Yours?”
</p>

<p>
<a id="1-11"></a> <b>11</b> God said to Solomon, “Since this was in your heart instead of requesting riches or wealth or glory for yourself or death for your enemies&#x2014;and since you have not even requested long life but have asked for wisdom and knowledge to govern My people over whom I have made you king&#x2014; 
<a id="1-12"></a> <b>12</b> therefore wisdom and knowledge have been granted to you. And I will also give you riches and wealth and honor unlike anything given to the kings before you or after you.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="1-13"></a> <b>13</b> So Solomon went to Jerusalem from the high place in Gibeon before the Tent of Meeting, and he reigned over Israel.

“Do for me as you did for my father David when you sent him cedars to build himself a house to live in. 
<a id="2-4"></a> <b>4</b> Behold, I am about to build a house for the Name of the LORD my God to dedicate to Him for burning fragrant incense before Him, for displaying the showbread continuously, and for making burnt offerings every morning and evening as well as on the Sabbaths, New Moons, and appointed feasts of the LORD our God. This is ordained for Israel forever.
</p>

<p>
<a id="2-5"></a> <b>5</b> The house that I am building will be great, for our God is greater than all gods. 
<a id="2-6"></a> <b>6</b> But who is able to build a house for Him, since the heavens, even the highest heavens, cannot contain Him? Who then am I, that I should build a house for Him, except as a place to burn sacrifices before Him?
</p>

<p>
<a id="2-7"></a> <b>7</b> Send me, therefore, a craftsman skilled in engraving to work with gold and silver, with bronze and iron, and with purple, crimson, and blue yarn. He will work with my craftsmen in Judah and Jerusalem, whom my father David provided.
</p>

<p>
<a id="2-8"></a> <b>8</b> Send me also cedar, cypress, and algum logs from Lebanon, for I know that your servants have skill to cut timber there. And indeed, my servants will work with yours 
<a id="2-9"></a> <b>9</b> to prepare for me timber in abundance, because the temple I am building will be great and wonderful. 
<a id="2-10"></a> <b>10</b> I will pay your servants, the woodcutters, 20,000 cors of ground wheat, 20,000 cors of barley, 20,000 baths of wine, and 20,000 baths of olive oil.”

“Because the LORD loves His people, He has set you over them as king.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="2-12"></a> <b>12</b> And Hiram added:

Then Solomon brought in the items his father David had dedicated&#x2014;the silver, the gold, and all the furnishings&#x2014;and he placed them in the treasuries of the house of God.

<p>
<a id="5-2"></a> <b>2</b> At that time Solomon assembled in Jerusalem the elders of Israel&#x2014;all the tribal heads and family leaders of the Israelites&#x2014;to bring up the ark of the covenant of the LORD from Zion, the City of David.

<p>
<a id="5-4"></a> <b>4</b> When all the elders of Israel had arrived, the Levites took up the ark, 
<a id="5-5"></a> <b>5</b> and they brought up the ark and the Tent of Meeting with all its sacred furnishings. The Levitical priests carried them up.

<p>
<a id="5-6"></a> <b>6</b> There, before the ark, King Solomon and the whole congregation of Israel who had assembled with him sacrificed so many sheep and oxen that they could not be counted or numbered.
</p>

<p>
<a id="5-7"></a> <b>7</b> Then the priests brought the ark of the covenant of the LORD to its place in the inner sanctuary of the temple, the Most Holy Place, beneath the wings of the cherubim. 
<a id="5-8"></a> <b>8</b> For the cherubim spread their wings over the place of the ark and overshadowed the ark and its poles.

<p>
<a id="5-9"></a> <b>9</b> The poles of the ark extended far enough that their ends were visible from in front of the inner sanctuary, but not from outside the Holy Place; and they are there to this day.

<a id="5-10"></a> <b>10</b> There was nothing in the ark except the two tablets that Moses had placed in it at Horeb, where the LORD had made a covenant with the Israelites after they had come out of Egypt.
</p>

<p>
<a id="5-11"></a> <b>11</b> Now all the priests who were present had consecrated themselves regardless of their divisions. And when the priests came out of the Holy Place, 
<a id="5-12"></a> <b>12</b> all the Levitical singers&#x2014;Asaph, Heman, Jeduthun, and their sons and relatives&#x2014;stood on the east side of the altar, dressed in fine linen and playing cymbals, harps, and lyres, accompanied by 120 priests sounding trumpets. 
<a id="5-13"></a> <b>13</b> The trumpeters and singers joined together to praise and thank the LORD with one voice. They lifted up their voices, accompanied by trumpets, cymbals, and musical instruments, in praise to the LORD:
</p>

<p>
“For He is good;

<p>
His loving devotion endures forever.”
</p>

<p>
And the temple, the house of the LORD, was filled with a cloud

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgb0934d2">
<p>
<a id="6-12"></a> <b>12</b> Then Solomon stood before the altar of the LORD in front of the whole assembly of Israel and spread out his hands. 
<a id="6-13"></a> <b>13</b> Now Solomon had made a bronze platform five cubits long, five cubits wide, and three cubits high, and had placed it in the middle of the courtyard. He stood on it, knelt down before the whole assembly of Israel, spread out his hands toward heaven, 
<a id="6-14"></a> <b>14</b> and said:
</p>

<p>
“O LORD, God of Israel, there is no God like You in heaven or on earth, keeping Your covenant of loving devotion with Your servants who walk before You with all their hearts. 
<a id="6-15"></a> <b>15</b> You have kept Your promise to Your servant, my father David. What You spoke with Your mouth You have fulfilled with Your hand this day.
</p>

<p>
<a id="6-16"></a> <b>16</b> Therefore now, O LORD, God of Israel, keep for Your servant, my father David, what You promised when You said: ‘You will never fail to have a man to sit before Me on the throne of Israel, if only your descendants guard their way to walk in My law as you have walked before Me.&rsquo; 
<a id="6-17"></a> <b>17</b> And now, O LORD, God of Israel, please confirm what You promised to Your servant David.
</p>

<p>
<a id="6-18"></a> <b>18</b> But will God indeed dwell with man upon the earth? Even heaven, the highest heaven, cannot contain You, much less this temple I have built. 
<a id="6-19"></a> <b>19</b> Yet regard the prayer and plea of Your servant, O LORD my God, so that You may hear the cry and the prayer that Your servant is praying before You.
</p>

<p>
<a id="6-20"></a> <b>20</b> May Your eyes be open toward this temple day and night, toward the place where You said You would put Your Name, so that You may hear the prayer that Your servant prays toward this place. 
<a id="6-21"></a> <b>21</b> Hear the plea of Your servant and of Your people Israel when they pray toward this place. May You hear from heaven, Your dwelling place. May You hear and forgive.
</p>

<p>
<a id="6-22"></a> <b>22</b> When a man sins against his neighbor and is required to take an oath, and he comes to take an oath before Your altar in this temple, 
<a id="6-23"></a> <b>23</b> then may You hear from heaven and act. May You judge Your servants, condemning the wicked man by bringing down on his own head what he has done, and justifying the righteous man by rewarding him according to his righteousness.
</p>

<p>
<a id="6-24"></a> <b>24</b> When Your people Israel are defeated before an enemy because they have sinned against You, and they return to You and confess Your name, praying and pleading before You in this temple, 
<a id="6-25"></a> <b>25</b> then may You hear from heaven and forgive the sin of Your people Israel. May You restore them to the land You gave to them and their fathers.
</p>

<p>
<a id="6-26"></a> <b>26</b> When the skies are shut and there is no rain because Your people have sinned against You, and they pray toward this place and confess Your name, and they turn from their sins because You have afflicted them, 
<a id="6-27"></a> <b>27</b> then may You hear from heaven and forgive the sin of Your servants, Your people Israel, so that You may teach them the good way in which they should walk. May You send rain on the land that You gave Your people as an inheritance.
</p>

<p>
<a id="6-28"></a> <b>28</b> When famine or plague comes upon the land, or blight or mildew or locusts or grasshoppers, or when their enemies besiege them in their cities, whatever plague or sickness may come, 
<a id="6-29"></a> <b>29</b> then may whatever prayer or petition Your people Israel make&#x2014;each knowing his own afflictions and spreading out his hands toward this temple&#x2014; 
<a id="6-30"></a> <b>30</b> be heard by You from heaven, Your dwelling place. And may You forgive and repay each man according to all his ways, since You know his heart&#x2014;for You alone know the hearts of men&#x2014; 
<a id="6-31"></a> <b>31</b> so that they may fear You and walk in Your ways all the days they live in the land that You gave to our fathers.
</p>

<p>
<a id="6-32"></a> <b>32</b> And as for the foreigner who is not of Your people Israel but has come from a distant land because of Your great name and Your mighty hand and outstretched arm&#x2014;when he comes and prays toward this temple, 
<a id="6-33"></a> <b>33</b> then may You hear from heaven, Your dwelling place, and do according to all for which the foreigner calls to You. Then all the peoples of the earth will know Your name and fear You, as do Your people Israel, and they will know that this house I have built is called by Your Name.
</p>

<p>
<a id="6-34"></a> <b>34</b> When Your people go to war against their enemies, wherever You send them, and when they pray to You in the direction of the city You have chosen and the house I have built for Your Name, 
<a id="6-35"></a> <b>35</b> then may You hear from heaven their prayer and their plea, and may You uphold their cause.
</p>

<p>
<a id="6-36"></a> <b>36</b> When they sin against You&#x2014;for there is no one who does not sin&#x2014;and You become angry with them and deliver them to an enemy who takes them as captives to a land far or near, 
<a id="6-37"></a> <b>37</b> and when they come to their senses in the land to which they were taken, and they repent and plead with You in the land of their captors, saying, ‘We have sinned and done wrong; we have acted wickedly,&rsquo; 
<a id="6-38"></a> <b>38</b> and when they return to You with all their heart and soul in the land of the enemies who took them captive, and when they pray in the direction of the land that You gave to their fathers, the city You have chosen, and the house I have built for Your Name, 
<a id="6-39"></a> <b>39</b> then may You hear from heaven, Your dwelling place, their prayer and petition, and may You uphold their cause. May You forgive Your people who sinned against You.
</p>

<p>
<a id="6-40"></a> <b>40</b> Now, my God, may Your eyes be open and Your ears attentive to the prayer offered in this place.
</p>

<p>
<a id="6-41"></a> <b>41</b> Now therefore, arise, O LORD God, and enter Your resting place,
</p>

<p>
You and the ark of Your might.
</p>

<p>
May Your priests, O LORD God, be clothed with salvation,
</p>

<p>
and may Your godly ones rejoice in goodness.
</p>

<p>
<a id="6-42"></a> <b>42</b> O LORD God, do not reject Your anointed one.
</p>

<p>
Remember Your loving devotion to Your servant David.”

<p>
<a id="7-1"></a> When Solomon had finished praying, fire came down from heaven and consumed the burnt offering and the sacrifices, and the glory of the LORD filled the temple. 
<a id="7-2"></a> <b>2</b> The priests were unable to enter the house of the LORD, because the glory of the LORD had filled it.
</p>

<p>
<a id="7-3"></a> <b>3</b> When all the Israelites saw the fire coming down and the glory of the LORD above the temple, they bowed down on the pavement with their faces to the ground, and they worshiped and gave thanks to the LORD:

<a id="7-4"></a> <b>4</b> Then the king and all the people offered sacrifices before the LORD. 
<a id="7-5"></a> <b>5</b> And King Solomon offered a sacrifice of 22,000 oxen and 120,000 sheep. So the king and all the people dedicated the house of God.
</p>

<p>
<a id="7-6"></a> <b>6</b> The priests stood at their posts, as did the Levites with the musical instruments of the LORD, which King David had made for giving thanks to the LORD and with which David had offered praise, saying, “For His loving devotion endures forever.” Across from the Levites, the priests sounded trumpets, and all the Israelites were standing.
</p>

<p>
<a id="7-7"></a> <b>7</b> Then Solomon consecrated the middle of the courtyard in front of the house of the LORD, and there he offered the burnt offerings and the fat of the peace offerings, since the bronze altar he had made could not contain all these offerings.
</p>

<p>
<a id="7-8"></a> <b>8</b> So at that time Solomon and all Israel with him&#x2014;a very great assembly of people from Lebo-hamath to the Brook of Egypt&#x2014;kept the feast for seven days. 
<a id="7-9"></a> <b>9</b> On the eighth day they held a solemn assembly, for the dedication of the altar had lasted seven days, and the feast seven days more.
</p>

<p>
<a id="7-10"></a> <b>10</b> On the twenty-third day of the seventh month, Solomon sent the people away to their homes, joyful and glad of heart for the good things that the LORD had done for David, for Solomon, and for His people Israel.

<p>
<a id="7-11"></a> <b>11</b> When Solomon had finished the house of the LORD and the royal palace, successfully carrying out all that was in his heart to do for the house of the LORD and for his own palace, 
<a id="7-12"></a> <b>12</b> the LORD appeared to him at night and said to him:
</p>

<p>
“I have heard your prayer and have chosen this place for Myself as a house of sacrifice. 
<a id="7-13"></a> <b>13</b> If I close the sky so there is no rain, or if I command the locust to devour the land, or if I send a plague among My people, 
<a id="7-14"></a> <b>14</b> and if My people who are called by My name humble themselves and pray and seek My face and turn from their wicked ways, then I will hear from heaven, forgive their sin, and heal their land.
</p>

<p>
<a id="7-15"></a> <b>15</b> Now My eyes will be open and My ears attentive to the prayers offered in this place. 
<a id="7-16"></a> <b>16</b> For I have now chosen and consecrated this temple so that My Name may be there forever. My eyes and My heart will be there for all time.

<p>
<a id="7-17"></a> <b>17</b> And as for you, if you walk before Me as your father David walked, doing all I have commanded you, and if you keep My statutes and ordinances, 
<a id="7-18"></a> <b>18</b> then I will establish your royal throne, as I covenanted with your father David when I said, ‘You will never fail to have a man to rule over Israel.&rsquo;
</p>

<p>
<a id="7-19"></a> <b>19</b> But if you turn away and forsake the statutes and commandments I have set before you, and if you go off to serve and worship other gods, 
<a id="7-20"></a> <b>20</b> then I will uproot Israel from the soil I have given them, and I will banish from My presence this temple I have sanctified for My Name. I will make it an object of scorn and ridicule among all the peoples.
</p>

<p>
<a id="7-21"></a> <b>21</b> And when this temple has become a heap of rubble, all who pass by it will be appalled and say, ‘Why has the LORD done such a thing to this land and to this temple?&rsquo; 
<a id="7-22"></a> <b>22</b> And others will answer, ‘Because they have forsaken the LORD, the God of their fathers, who brought them out of the land of Egypt, and have embraced other gods, worshiping and serving them&#x2014;because of this, He has brought all this disaster upon them.&rsquo; ”

<p>
<a id="8-1"></a> Now at the end of the twenty years during which Solomon had built the house of the LORD and his own palace, 
<a id="8-2"></a> <b>2</b> Solomon rebuilt the cities Hiram had given him and settled Israelites there.
</p>

<p>
<a id="8-3"></a> <b>3</b> Then Solomon went to Hamath-zobah and captured it. 
<a id="8-4"></a> <b>4</b> He built Tadmor in the wilderness, in addition to all the store cities that he had built in Hamath. 
<a id="8-5"></a> <b>5</b> He rebuilt Upper and Lower Beth-horon as fortified cities with walls, gates, and bars, 
<a id="8-6"></a> <b>6</b> as well as Baalath, all the store cities that belonged to Solomon, and all the cities for his chariots and horses &#x2014;whatever he desired to build in Jerusalem, Lebanon, and throughout the land of his dominion.
</p>

<p>
<a id="8-7"></a> <b>7</b> As for all the people who remained of the Hittites, Amorites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites (the people who were not Israelites)&#x2014; 
<a id="8-8"></a> <b>8</b> their descendants who remained in the land, those whom the Israelites were unable to destroy&#x2014;Solomon conscripted these people to be forced laborers, as they are to this day.
</p>

<p>
<a id="8-9"></a> <b>9</b> But Solomon did not consign any of the Israelites to slave labor, because they were his men of war, his officers and captains, and the commanders of his chariots and cavalry. 
<a id="8-10"></a> <b>10</b> They were also the chief officers for King Solomon: 250 supervisors.
</p>

<p>
<a id="8-11"></a> <b>11</b> Solomon brought the daughter of Pharaoh up from the City of David to the palace he had built for her. For he said, “My wife must not live in the house of David king of Israel, because the places the ark of the LORD has entered are holy.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="8-12"></a> <b>12</b> At that time Solomon offered burnt offerings to the LORD on the altar of the LORD he had built in front of the portico. 
<a id="8-13"></a> <b>13</b> He observed the daily requirement for offerings according to the commandment of Moses for Sabbaths, New Moons, and the three annual appointed feasts&#x2014;the Feast of Unleavened Bread, the Feast of Weeks, and the Feast of Tabernacles.
</p>

<p>
<a id="8-14"></a> <b>14</b> In keeping with the ordinances of his father David, Solomon appointed the divisions of the priests over their service, and the Levites for their duties to offer praise and to minister before the priests according to the daily requirement. He also appointed gatekeepers by their divisions at each gate, for this had been the command of David, the man of God. 
<a id="8-15"></a> <b>15</b> They did not turn aside from the king&rsquo;s command regarding the priests or the Levites or any matter concerning the treasuries.
</p>

<p>
<a id="8-16"></a> <b>16</b> Thus all the work of Solomon was carried out, from the day the foundation was laid for the house of the LORD until it was finished. So the house of the LORD was completed.
</p>

<p>
<a id="8-17"></a> <b>17</b> Then Solomon went to Ezion-geber and to Eloth on the coast of Edom. 
<a id="8-18"></a> <b>18</b> So Hiram sent him ships captained by his servants, along with crews of experienced sailors. They went with Solomon&rsquo;s servants to Ophir and acquired from there 450 talents of gold, which they delivered to King Solomon.

</p>

<p>
<a id="9-1"></a> Now when the queen of Sheba heard about the fame of Solomon, she came to test him with difficult questions. She arrived in Jerusalem with a very large caravan&#x2014;with camels bearing spices, gold in abundance, and precious stones.
</p>

<p>
So she came to Solomon and spoke with him about all that was on her mind. 
<a id="9-2"></a> <b>2</b> And Solomon answered all her questions; nothing was too difficult for him to explain.
</p>

<p>
<a id="9-3"></a> <b>3</b> When the queen of Sheba saw the wisdom of Solomon, the palace he had built, 
<a id="9-4"></a> <b>4</b> the food at his table, the seating of his servants, the service and attire of his attendants and cupbearers, and the burnt offerings he presented at the house of the LORD, it took her breath away.
</p>

<p>
<a id="9-5"></a> <b>5</b> She said to the king, “The report I heard in my own country about your words and wisdom is true. 
<a id="9-6"></a> <b>6</b> But I did not believe the reports until I came and saw with my own eyes. Indeed, not half of the greatness of your wisdom was told to me. You have far exceeded the report I heard. 
<a id="9-7"></a> <b>7</b> How blessed are your men! How blessed are these servants of yours who stand continually before you and hear your wisdom! 
<a id="9-8"></a> <b>8</b> Blessed be the LORD your God, who has delighted in you to set you on His throne to be king for the LORD your God. Because your God loved Israel enough to establish them forever, He has made you king over them to carry out justice and righteousness.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="9-9"></a> <b>9</b> Then she gave the king 120 talents of gold, a great quantity of spices, and precious stones. There had never been such spices as those the queen of Sheba gave to King Solomon.
</p>

<p>
10(The servants of Hiram and of Solomon who brought gold from Ophir also brought algum wood and precious stones. 
<a id="9-11"></a> <b>11</b> The king made the algum wood into steps for the house of the LORD and for the king&rsquo;s palace, and into lyres and harps for the singers. Never before had anything like them been seen in the land of Judah.)
</p>

<p>
<a id="9-12"></a> <b>12</b> King Solomon gave the queen of Sheba all she desired&#x2014;whatever she asked&#x2014;far more than she had brought the king. Then she left and returned to her own country, along with her servants.

<a id="9-14"></a> <b>14</b> not including the revenue from the merchants and traders. And all the Arabian kings and governors of the land also brought gold and silver to Solomon.
</p>

<p>
<a id="9-15"></a> <b>15</b> King Solomon made two hundred large shields of hammered gold; six hundred shekels of hammered gold went into each shield. 
<a id="9-16"></a> <b>16</b> He also made three hundred small shields of hammered gold; three hundred shekels of gold went into each shield. And the king put them in the House of the Forest of Lebanon.
</p>

<p>
<a id="9-17"></a> <b>17</b> Additionally, the king made a great throne of ivory and overlaid it with pure gold. 
<a id="9-18"></a> <b>18</b> The throne had six steps, and a footstool of gold was attached to it. There were armrests on both sides of the seat, with a lion standing beside each armrest. 
<a id="9-19"></a> <b>19</b> Twelve lions stood on the six steps, one at either end of each step. Nothing like this had ever been made for any kingdom.
</p>

<p>
<a id="9-20"></a> <b>20</b> All King Solomon&rsquo;s drinking cups were gold, and all the utensils of the House of the Forest of Lebanon were pure gold. There was no silver, because it was accounted as nothing in the days of Solomon. 
<a id="9-21"></a> <b>21</b> For the king had the ships of Tarshish that went with Hiram&rsquo;s servants, and once every three years the ships of Tarshish would arrive bearing gold, silver, ivory, apes, and peacocks.
</p>

<p>
<a id="9-22"></a> <b>22</b> So King Solomon surpassed all the kings of the earth in riches and wisdom.

</p>

<p>
<a id="9-25"></a> <b>25</b> Solomon had 4,000 stalls for horses and chariots, and 12,000 horses, which he stationed in the chariot cities and also with him in Jerusalem. 
<a id="9-26"></a> <b>26</b> He reigned over all the kings from the Euphrates to the land of the Philistines, as far as the border of Egypt. 
<a id="9-27"></a> <b>27</b> The king made silver as common in Jerusalem as stones, and cedar as abundant as sycamore in the foothills.

<p>
<a id="10-1"></a> Then Rehoboam went to Shechem, for all Israel had gone there to make him king. 
<a id="10-2"></a> <b>2</b> When Jeroboam son of Nebat heard about this, he returned from Egypt, where he had fled from King Solomon. 
<a id="10-3"></a> <b>3</b> So they sent for Jeroboam, and he and all Israel came to Rehoboam and said,
<a id="10-4"></a> <b>4</b> “Your father put a heavy yoke on us. But now you should lighten the burden of your father&rsquo;s service and the heavy yoke he put on us, and we will serve you.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="10-5"></a> <b>5</b> Rehoboam answered, “Come back to me in three days.” So the people departed.
</p>

<p>
<a id="10-6"></a> <b>6</b> Then King Rehoboam consulted with the elders who had served his father Solomon during his lifetime. “How do you advise me to respond to these people?” he asked.

<p>
<a id="10-7"></a> <b>7</b> They replied, “If you will be kind to these people and please them by speaking kind words to them, they will be your servants forever.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="10-8"></a> <b>8</b> But Rehoboam rejected the advice of the elders; instead, he consulted the young men who had grown up with him and served him. 
<a id="10-9"></a> <b>9</b> He asked them, “What message do you advise that we send back to these people who have spoken to me, saying, ‘Lighten the yoke your father put on us&rsquo;?”
</p>

<p>
<a id="10-10"></a> <b>10</b> The young men who had grown up with him replied, “This is how you should answer these people who said to you, ‘Your father made our yoke heavy, but you should make it lighter.&rsquo; This is what you should tell them: ‘My little finger is thicker than my father&rsquo;s waist! 
<a id="10-11"></a> <b>11</b> Whereas my father burdened you with a heavy yoke, I will add to your yoke. Whereas my father scourged you with whips, I will scourge you with scorpions.&rsquo; ”

<p>

<a id="10-13"></a> <b>13</b> And the king answered them harshly. King Rehoboam rejected the advice of the elders 
<a id="10-14"></a> <b>14</b> and spoke to them as the young men had advised, saying, “Whereas my father made your yoke heavy, I will add to your yoke. Whereas my father scourged you with whips, I will scourge you with scorpions.”

<p>
<a id="10-15"></a> <b>15</b> So the king did not listen to the people, and indeed this turn of events was from God, in order that the LORD might fulfill the word that He had spoken through Ahijah the Shilonite to Jeroboam son of Nebat.

<a id="13-5"></a> <b>5</b> Do you not know that the LORD, the God of Israel, has given the kingship of Israel to David and his descendants forever by a covenant of salt? 
<a id="13-6"></a> <b>6</b> Yet Jeroboam son of Nebat, a servant of Solomon son of David, rose up and rebelled against his master. 
<a id="13-7"></a> <b>7</b> Then worthless and wicked men gathered around him to resist Rehoboam son of Solomon when he was young, inexperienced, and unable to resist them.
</p>

<p>
<a id="13-8"></a> <b>8</b> And now you think you can resist the kingdom of the LORD, which is in the hands of David&rsquo;s descendants. You are indeed a vast army, and you have with you the golden calves that Jeroboam made for you as gods. 
<a id="13-9"></a> <b>9</b> But did you not drive out the priests of the LORD, the sons of Aaron, and the Levites? And did you not make priests for yourselves as do the peoples of other lands? Now whoever comes to consecrate himself with a young bull and seven rams can become a priest of things that are not gods.
</p>

<p>
<a id="13-10"></a> <b>10</b> But as for us, the LORD is our God. We have not forsaken Him; the priests who minister to the LORD are sons of Aaron, and the Levites attend to their duties. 
<a id="13-11"></a> <b>11</b> Every morning and every evening they present burnt offerings and fragrant incense to the LORD. They set out the rows of showbread on the ceremonially clean table, and every evening they light the lamps of the gold lampstand. We are carrying out the requirements of the LORD our God, while you have forsaken Him.
</p>

<p>
<a id="13-12"></a> <b>12</b> Now behold, God Himself is with us as our head, and His priests with their trumpets sound the battle call against you. O children of Israel, do not fight against the LORD, the God of your fathers, for you will not succeed.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="13-13"></a> <b>13</b> Now Jeroboam had sent troops around to ambush from the rear, so that while he was in front of Judah, the ambush was behind them. 
<a id="13-14"></a> <b>14</b> When Judah turned and discovered that the battle was both before and behind them, they cried out to the LORD. Then the priests blew the trumpets, 
<a id="13-15"></a> <b>15</b> and the men of Judah raised the battle cry. And when they raised the cry, God routed Jeroboam and all Israel before Abijah and Judah.

<p>
<a id="13-16"></a> <b>16</b> So the Israelites fled before Judah, and God delivered them into their hands.

<a id="13-18"></a> <b>18</b> Thus the Israelites were subdued at that time, and the men of Judah prevailed because they relied on the LORD, the God of their fathers.

<a id="14-4"></a> <b>4</b> He commanded the people of Judah to seek the LORD, the God of their fathers, and to observe the law and the commandments. 
<a id="14-5"></a> <b>5</b> He also removed the high places and incense altars from all the cities of Judah, and under him the kingdom was at peace.

<a id="14-7"></a> <b>7</b> So he said to the people of Judah, “Let us build these cities and surround them with walls and towers, with doors and bars. The land is still ours because we have sought the LORD our God. We have sought Him and He has given us rest on every side.” So they built and prospered.
</p>

<p>
<a id="14-8"></a> <b>8</b> Asa had an army of 300,000 men from Judah bearing large shields and spears, and 280,000 men from Benjamin bearing small shields and drawing the bow. All these were mighty men of valor.
</p>

<p>
<a id="14-9"></a> <b>9</b> Then Zerah the Cushite came against them with an army of 1,000,000 men and 300 chariots, and they advanced as far as Mareshah. 
<a id="14-10"></a> <b>10</b> So Asa marched out against him and lined up in battle formation in the Valley of Zephathah near Mareshah.
</p>

<p>
<a id="14-11"></a> <b>11</b> Then Asa cried out to the LORD his God: “O LORD, there is no one besides You to help the powerless against the mighty.

</p>

<p>
<a id="14-12"></a> <b>12</b> So the LORD struck down the Cushites before Asa and Judah, and the Cushites fled. 
<a id="14-13"></a> <b>13</b> Then Asa and his army pursued them as far as Gerar. The Cushites fell and could not recover, for they were crushed before the LORD and His army. So the people of Judah carried off a great amount of plunder 
<a id="14-14"></a> <b>14</b> and attacked all the cities around Gerar, because the terror of the LORD had fallen upon them. They plundered all the cities, since there was much plunder there.

<p>
<a id="17-1"></a> Asa&rsquo;s son Jehoshaphat reigned in his place, and he strengthened himself against Israel. 
<a id="17-2"></a> <b>2</b> He stationed troops in every fortified city of Judah and put garrisons in the land of Judah and in the cities of Ephraim that his father Asa had captured.
</p>

<p>
<a id="17-3"></a> <b>3</b> Now the LORD was with Jehoshaphat because he walked in the earlier ways of his father David. He did not seek out the Baals, 
<a id="17-4"></a> <b>4</b> but he sought the God of his father and walked by His commandments rather than the practices of Israel. 
<a id="17-5"></a> <b>5</b> So the LORD established the kingdom in his hand, and all Judah brought him tribute, so that he had an abundance of riches and honor.

</p>

<p>
<a id="17-7"></a> <b>7</b> In the third year of his reign, Jehoshaphat sent his officials Ben-hail, Obadiah, Zechariah, Nethanel, and Micaiah to teach in the cities of Judah,

<a id="17-9"></a> <b>9</b> They taught throughout Judah, taking with them the Book of the Law of the LORD. They went throughout the towns of Judah and taught the people.

<p>
<a id="17-10"></a> <b>10</b> And the dread of the LORD fell upon all the kingdoms of the lands that surrounded Judah, so that they did not make war against Jehoshaphat. 
<a id="17-11"></a> <b>11</b> Some Philistines also brought gifts and silver as tribute to Jehoshaphat, and the Arabs brought him 7,700 rams and 7,700 goats from their flocks.

<p>
<a id="17-12"></a> <b>12</b> Jehoshaphat grew stronger and stronger, and he built fortresses and store cities in Judah

<p>
<a id="18-3"></a> <b>3</b> Ahab king of Israel asked Jehoshaphat king of Judah, “Will you go with me against Ramoth-gilead?”

<p>
And Jehoshaphat replied, “I am like you, and my people are your people; we will join you in the war.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="18-4"></a> <b>4</b> But Jehoshaphat also said to the king of Israel, “Please inquire first for the word of the LORD.”

<p>
<a id="18-5"></a> <b>5</b> So the king of Israel assembled the prophets, four hundred men, and asked them, “Should we go to war against Ramoth-gilead, or should we refrain?”

<p>
“Go up,” they replied, “and God will deliver it into the hand of the king.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="18-6"></a> <b>6</b> But Jehoshaphat asked, “Is there not still a prophet of the LORD here of whom we can inquire?”
</p>

<p>
<a id="18-7"></a> <b>7</b> The king of Israel answered, “There is still one man who can ask the LORD, but I hate him because he never prophesies anything good for me, but only bad. He is Micaiah son of Imlah.”
</p>

<p>
“The king should not say that!” Jehoshaphat replied.
</p>

<p>
<a id="18-8"></a> <b>8</b> So the king of Israel called one of his officials and said, “Bring Micaiah son of Imlah at once.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="18-9"></a> <b>9</b> Dressed in royal attire, the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat king of Judah were sitting on their thrones at the threshing floor by the entrance of the gate of Samaria, with all the prophets prophesying before them.

<p>
<a id="18-10"></a> <b>10</b> Now Zedekiah son of Chenaanah had made for himself iron horns and declared, “This is what the LORD says: ‘With these you shall gore the Arameans until they are finished off.&rsquo; ”

<p>
<a id="18-13"></a> <b>13</b> But Micaiah said, “As surely as the LORD lives, I will speak whatever my God tells me.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="18-14"></a> <b>14</b> When Micaiah arrived, the king asked him, “Micaiah, should we go to war against Ramoth-gilead, or should we refrain?”
</p>

<p>
“Go up and triumph,” Micaiah replied, “for they will be given into your hand.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="18-15"></a> <b>15</b> But the king said to him, “How many times must I make you swear not to tell me anything but the truth in the name of the LORD?”
</p>

<p>
<a id="18-16"></a> <b>16</b> So Micaiah declared:

“I saw all Israel scattered on the hills

<p>
And the LORD said, ‘These people have no master;

<p>
<a id="18-17"></a> <b>17</b> Then the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, “Did I not tell you that he never prophesies good for me, but only bad?”
</p>

<p>
<a id="18-18"></a> <b>18</b> Micaiah continued, “Therefore hear the word of the LORD: I saw the LORD sitting on His throne, and all the host of heaven standing on His right and on His left.
</p>

<p>
<a id="18-19"></a> <b>19</b> And the LORD said, ‘Who will entice Ahab king of Israel to march up and fall at Ramoth-gilead?&rsquo;
</p>

<p>
And one suggested this, and another that.
</p>

<p>
<a id="18-20"></a> <b>20</b> Then a spirit came forward, stood before the LORD, and said, ‘I will entice him.&rsquo;

<p>
‘By what means?&rsquo; asked the LORD.

<p>
<a id="18-21"></a> <b>21</b> And he replied, ‘I will go out and be a lying spirit in the mouths of all his prophets.&rsquo;
</p>

<p>
‘You will surely entice him and prevail,&rsquo; said the LORD. ‘Go and do it.&rsquo;
</p>

<p>
<a id="18-22"></a> <b>22</b> So you see, the LORD has put a lying spirit in the mouths of these prophets of yours, and the LORD has pronounced disaster against you.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="18-23"></a> <b>23</b> Then Zedekiah son of Chenaanah went up, struck Micaiah in the face, and demanded, “Which way did the Spirit of the LORD go when He departed from me to speak with you?”
</p>

<p>
<a id="18-24"></a> <b>24</b> Micaiah replied, “You will soon see, on that day when you go and hide in an inner room.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="18-25"></a> <b>25</b> And the king of Israel declared, “Take Micaiah and return him to Amon the governor of the city and to Joash the king&rsquo;s son,

<p>

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org79ae9ff">
<p>
<a id="25-5"></a> <b>5</b> Then Amaziah gathered the people of Judah and assigned them according to their families to commanders of thousands and of hundreds. And he numbered those twenty years of age or older throughout Judah and Benjamin and found 300,000 chosen men able to serve in the army, bearing the spear and shield.
</p>

<p>
<a id="25-6"></a> <b>6</b> He also hired 100,000 mighty warriors from Israel for a hundred talents of silver. 
<a id="25-7"></a> <b>7</b> But a man of God came to him and said, “O king, do not let the army of Israel go with you, for the LORD is not with Israel&#x2014;not with any of the Ephraimites. 
<a id="25-8"></a> <b>8</b> Even if you go and fight bravely in battle, God will make you stumble before the enemy, for God has power to help and power to overthrow.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="25-9"></a> <b>9</b> Amaziah asked the man of God, “What should I do about the hundred talents I have given to the army of Israel?”
</p>

<p>
And the man of God replied, “The LORD is able to give you much more than this.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="25-10"></a> <b>10</b> So Amaziah dismissed the troops who had come to him from Ephraim and sent them home. And they were furious with Judah and returned home in great anger.
</p>

<p>
<a id="25-11"></a> <b>11</b> Amaziah, however, summoned his strength and led his troops to the Valley of Salt, where he struck down 10,000 men of Seir, 
<a id="25-12"></a> <b>12</b> and the army of Judah also captured 10,000 men alive. They took them to the top of a cliff and threw them down so that all were dashed to pieces.
</p>

<p>
<a id="25-13"></a> <b>13</b> Meanwhile the troops that Amaziah had dismissed from battle raided the cities of Judah, from Samaria to Beth-horon. They struck down 3,000 people and carried off a great deal of plunder.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org09f6e4f">

<a id="25-14"></a> <b>14</b> When Amaziah returned from the slaughter of the Edomites, he brought back the gods of the Seirites, set them up as his own gods, bowed before them, and burned sacrifices to them. 
<a id="25-15"></a> <b>15</b> Therefore the anger of the LORD burned against Amaziah, and He sent him a prophet, who said, “Why have you sought this people&rsquo;s gods, which could not deliver them from your hand?”
</p>

<p>
<a id="25-16"></a> <b>16</b> While he was still speaking, the king asked, “Have we made you the counselor to the king? Stop! Why be struck down?”
</p>

<p>
So the prophet stopped, but he said, “I know that God has determined to destroy you, because you have done this and have not heeded my advice.”

<a id="25-17"></a> <b>17</b> Then Amaziah king of Judah took counsel and sent word to the king of Israel Jehoash son of Jehoahaz, the son of Jehu. “Come, let us meet face to face,” he said.
</p>

<p>
<a id="25-18"></a> <b>18</b> But Jehoash king of Israel replied to Amaziah king of Judah: “A thistle in Lebanon sent a message to a cedar in Lebanon, saying, ‘Give your daughter to my son in marriage.&rsquo; Then a wild beast in Lebanon came along and trampled the thistle. 
<a id="25-19"></a> <b>19</b> You have said, ‘Look, I have defeated Edom,&rsquo; and your heart has become proud and boastful. Now stay at home. Why should you stir up trouble so that you fall&#x2014;you and Judah with you?”
</p>

<p>
<a id="25-20"></a> <b>20</b> But Amaziah would not listen, for this had come from God in order to deliver them into the hand of Jehoash, because they had sought the gods of Edom. 
<a id="25-21"></a> <b>21</b> So Jehoash king of Israel advanced, and he and Amaziah king of Judah faced each other at Beth-shemesh in Judah. 
<a id="25-22"></a> <b>22</b> And Judah was routed before Israel, and every man fled to his own home.
</p>

<p>
<a id="25-23"></a> <b>23</b> There at Beth-shemesh, Jehoash king of Israel captured Amaziah king of Judah, the son of Joash, the son of Jehoahaz.

<p>
Then Jehoash brought him to Jerusalem and broke down the wall of Jerusalem from the Ephraim Gate to the Corner Gate&#x2014;a section of four hundred cubits. 
<a id="25-24"></a> <b>24</b> He took all the gold and silver and all the articles found in the house of God with Obed-edom and in the treasuries of the royal palace, as well as some hostages. Then he returned to Samaria.

<p>
<a id="26-1"></a> All the people of Judah took Uzziah, who was sixteen years old, and made him king in place of his father Amaziah. 
<a id="26-2"></a> <b>2</b> Uzziah was the one who rebuilt Eloth and restored it to Judah after King Amaziah rested with his fathers.
</p>

<p>
<a id="26-3"></a> <b>3</b> Uzziah was sixteen years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem fifty-two years. His mother&rsquo;s name was Jecoliah; she was from Jerusalem. 
<a id="26-4"></a> <b>4</b> And he did what was right in the eyes of the LORD, just as his father Amaziah had done. 
<a id="26-5"></a> <b>5</b> He sought God throughout the days of Zechariah, who instructed him in the fear of God. And as long as he sought the LORD, God gave him success.
</p>

<p>
<a id="26-6"></a> <b>6</b> Uzziah went out to wage war against the Philistines, and he tore down the walls of Gath, Jabneh, and Ashdod. Then he built cities near Ashdod and among the Philistines. 
<a id="26-7"></a> <b>7</b> God helped him against the Philistines, against the Arabs living in Gur-baal, and against the Meunites. 
<a id="26-8"></a> <b>8</b> The Ammonites brought tribute to Uzziah, and his fame spread as far as the border of Egypt, for he had become exceedingly powerful.
</p>

<p>
<a id="26-9"></a> <b>9</b> Uzziah built towers in Jerusalem at the Corner Gate, the Valley Gate, and the angle in the wall, and he fortified them. 
<a id="26-10"></a> <b>10</b> Since he had much livestock in the foothills and in the plain, he built towers in the desert and dug many cisterns. And since he was a lover of the soil, he had farmers and vinedressers in the hill country and in the fertile fields.
</p>

<p>
<a id="26-11"></a> <b>11</b> Uzziah had an army ready for battle that went out to war by assigned divisions, as recorded by Jeiel the scribe and Maaseiah the officer under the direction of Hananiah, one of the royal officers. 
<a id="26-12"></a> <b>12</b> The total number of family leaders of the mighty men of valor was 2,600. 
<a id="26-13"></a> <b>13</b> Under their authority was an army of 307,500 trained for war, a powerful force to support the king against his enemies.
</p>

<p>
<a id="26-14"></a> <b>14</b> Uzziah supplied the entire army with shields, spears, helmets, armor, bows, and slingstones. 
<a id="26-15"></a> <b>15</b> And in Jerusalem he made skillfully designed devices to shoot arrows and catapult large stones from the towers and corners. So his fame spread far and wide, for he was helped tremendously so that he became powerful.
</p>

<p>
<a id="26-16"></a> <b>16</b> But when Uzziah grew powerful, his arrogance led to his own destruction. He was unfaithful to the LORD his God, for he entered the temple of the LORD to burn incense on the altar of incense.
</p>

<p>
<a id="26-17"></a> <b>17</b> Then Azariah the priest, along with eighty brave priests of the LORD, went in after him. 
<a id="26-18"></a> <b>18</b> They took their stand against King Uzziah and said, “Uzziah, you have no right to offer incense to the LORD. Only the priests, the descendants of Aaron, are consecrated to burn incense. Leave the sanctuary, for you have acted unfaithfully; you will not receive honor from the LORD God.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="26-19"></a> <b>19</b> Uzziah, with a censer in his hand to offer incense, was enraged. But while he raged against the priests in their presence in the house of the LORD before the altar of incense, leprosy broke out on his forehead. 
<a id="26-20"></a> <b>20</b> When Azariah the chief priest and all the priests turned to him and saw his leprous forehead, they rushed him out. Indeed, he himself hurried to get out, because the LORD had afflicted him.
</p>

<p>
<a id="26-21"></a> <b>21</b> So King Uzziah was a leper until the day of his death. He lived in isolation, leprous and cut off from the house of the LORD, while his son Jotham had charge of the royal palace to govern the people of the land.
</p>

<p>
<a id="26-22"></a> <b>22</b> As for the rest of the acts of Uzziah, from beginning to end, they are recorded by the prophet Isaiah son of Amoz. 
<a id="26-23"></a> <b>23</b> And Uzziah rested with his fathers and was buried near them in a field of burial that belonged to the kings; for the people said, “He was a leper.” And his son Jotham reigned in his place.

<a id="27-2"></a> <b>2</b> And he did what was right in the eyes of the LORD, just as his father Uzziah had done. In addition, he did not enter the temple of the LORD. But the people still behaved corruptly.
</p>

<p>
<a id="27-3"></a> <b>3</b> Jotham rebuilt the Upper Gate of the house of the LORD, and he worked extensively on the wall at the hill of Ophel. 
<a id="27-4"></a> <b>4</b> He also built cities in the hill country of Judah and fortresses and towers in the forests.
</p>

<p>
<a id="27-5"></a> <b>5</b> Jotham waged war against the king of the Ammonites and defeated them, and that year they gave him a hundred talents of silver, ten thousand cors of wheat, and ten thousand cors of barley. They paid him the same in the second and third years. 
<a id="27-6"></a> <b>6</b> So Jotham grew powerful because he ordered his ways before the LORD his God.

</p>

<p>
Ahaz was also delivered into the hand of the king of Israel, who struck him with great force. 
<a id="28-6"></a> <b>6</b> For in one day Pekah son of Remaliah killed 120,000 valiant men in Judah. This happened because they had forsaken the LORD, the God of their fathers. 
<a id="28-7"></a> <b>7</b> Zichri, a mighty man of Ephraim, killed Maaseiah the son of the king, Azrikam the governor of the palace, and Elkanah the second to the king. 
<a id="28-8"></a> <b>8</b> Then the Israelites took 200,000 captives from their kinsmen&#x2014;women, sons, and daughters. They also carried off a great deal of plunder and brought it to Samaria.
</p>

<p>
<a id="28-9"></a> <b>9</b> But a prophet of the LORD named Oded was there, and he went out to meet the army that returned to Samaria. “Look,” he said to them, “because of His wrath against Judah, the LORD, the God of your fathers, has delivered them into your hand. But you have slaughtered them in a rage that reaches up to heaven. 
<a id="28-10"></a> <b>10</b> And now you intend to reduce to slavery the men and women of Judah and Jerusalem. But are you not also guilty before the LORD your God? 
<a id="28-11"></a> <b>11</b> Now therefore, listen to me and return the captives you took from your kinsmen, for the fierce anger of the LORD is upon you.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="28-12"></a> <b>12</b> Then some of the leaders of the Ephraimites&#x2014;Azariah son of Jehohanan, Berechiah son of Meshillemoth, Jehizkiah son of Shallum, and Amasa son of Hadlai&#x2014;stood in opposition to those arriving from the war.
<a id="28-13"></a> <b>13</b> “You must not bring the captives here,” they said, “for you are proposing to bring guilt upon us from the LORD and to add to our sins and our guilt. For our guilt is great, and fierce anger is upon Israel.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="28-14"></a> <b>14</b> So the armed men left the captives and the plunder before the leaders and all the assembly. 
<a id="28-15"></a> <b>15</b> Then the men who were designated by name arose, took charge of the captives, and provided from the plunder clothing for the naked. They clothed them, gave them sandals and food and drink, anointed their wounds, and put all the feeble on donkeys. So they brought them to Jericho, the City of Palms, to their brothers.

<a id="28-17"></a> <b>17</b> The Edomites had again come and attacked Judah and carried away captives. 
<a id="28-18"></a> <b>18</b> The Philistines had also raided the cities of the foothills and the Negev of Judah, capturing and occupying Beth-shemesh, Aijalon, and Gederoth, as well as Soco, Timnah, and Gimzo with their villages. 
<a id="28-19"></a> <b>19</b> For the LORD humbled Judah because Ahaz king of Israel had thrown off restraint in Judah and had been most unfaithful to the LORD.
</p>

<p>
<a id="28-20"></a> <b>20</b> Then Tiglath-pileser king of Assyria came to Ahaz but afflicted him rather than strengthening him. 
<a id="28-21"></a> <b>21</b> Although Ahaz had taken a portion from the house of the LORD, from the royal palace, and from the princes and had presented it to the king of Assyria, it did not help him.
</p>

<p>
<a id="28-22"></a> <b>22</b> In the time of his distress, King Ahaz became even more unfaithful to the LORD. 
<a id="28-23"></a> <b>23</b> Since Damascus had defeated him, he sacrificed to their gods and said, “Because the gods of the kings of Aram have helped them, I will sacrifice to them that they may help me.” But these gods were the downfall of Ahaz and of all Israel.

<p>
<a id="28-24"></a> <b>24</b> Then Ahaz gathered up the articles of the house of God, cut them into pieces, shut the doors of the house of the LORD, and set up altars of his own on every street corner in Jerusalem. 
<a id="28-25"></a> <b>25</b> In every city of Judah he built high places to offer incense to other gods, and so he provoked the LORD, the God of his fathers.

</p>

<p>
<a id="29-5"></a> <b>5</b> “Listen to me, O Levites,” he said. “Consecrate yourselves now and consecrate the house of the LORD, the God of your fathers. Remove from the Holy Place every impurity.

<p>
<a id="29-6"></a> <b>6</b> For our fathers were unfaithful and did evil in the sight of the LORD our God. They abandoned Him, turned their faces away from the dwelling place of the LORD, and turned their backs on Him. 
<a id="29-7"></a> <b>7</b> They also shut the doors of the portico and extinguished the lamps. They did not burn incense or present burnt offerings in the Holy Place of the God of Israel.

<p>
<a id="29-8"></a> <b>8</b> Therefore, the wrath of the LORD has fallen upon Judah and Jerusalem, and He has made them an object of terror, horror, and mockery, as you can see with your own eyes.

<a id="29-25"></a> <b>25</b> Hezekiah stationed the Levites in the house of the LORD with cymbals, harps, and lyres according to the command of David, of Gad the king&rsquo;s seer, and of Nathan the prophet. For the command had come from the LORD through His prophets. 
<a id="29-26"></a> <b>26</b> The Levites stood with the instruments of David, and the priests with the trumpets.
</p>

<p>
<a id="29-27"></a> <b>27</b> And Hezekiah ordered that the burnt offering be sacrificed on the altar. When the burnt offering began, the song of the LORD and the trumpets began as well, accompanied by the instruments of David king of Israel. 
<a id="29-28"></a> <b>28</b> The whole assembly was worshiping, the singers were singing, and the trumpeters were playing. All this continued until the burnt offering was completed.
</p>

<p>
<a id="29-29"></a> <b>29</b> When the offerings were completed, the king and all those present with him bowed down and worshiped. 
<a id="29-30"></a> <b>30</b> Then King Hezekiah and his officials ordered the Levites to sing praises to the LORD in the words of David and of Asaph the seer. So they sang praises with gladness and bowed their heads and worshiped.
</p>

<p>
<a id="29-31"></a> <b>31</b> Then Hezekiah said, “Now that you have consecrated yourselves to the LORD, come near and bring sacrifices and thank offerings to the house of the LORD.”
</p>

<p>
So the assembly brought sacrifices and thank offerings, and all whose hearts were willing brought burnt offerings. 
<a id="29-32"></a> <b>32</b> The number of burnt offerings the assembly brought was seventy bulls, a hundred rams, and two hundred lambs; all these were for a burnt offering to the LORD. 
<a id="29-33"></a> <b>33</b> And the consecrated offerings were six hundred bulls and three thousand sheep.
</p>

<p>
<a id="29-34"></a> <b>34</b> However, since there were not enough priests to skin all the burnt offerings, their Levite brothers helped them until the work was finished and until the priests had been consecrated. For the Levites had been more diligent in consecrating themselves than the priests had been.
</p>

<p>
<a id="29-35"></a> <b>35</b> Furthermore, the burnt offerings were abundant, along with the fat of the peace offerings and the drink offerings for the burnt offerings. So the service of the house of the LORD was established. 
<a id="29-36"></a> <b>36</b> Then Hezekiah and all the people rejoiced at what God had prepared for the people, because everything had been accomplished so quickly.

<p>
<a id="30-1"></a> Then Hezekiah sent word throughout all Israel and Judah, and he also wrote letters to Ephraim and Manasseh inviting them to come to the house of the LORD in Jerusalem to keep the Passover of the LORD, the God of Israel. 
<a id="30-2"></a> <b>2</b> For the king and his officials and the whole assembly in Jerusalem had decided to keep the Passover in the second month, 
<a id="30-3"></a> <b>3</b> since they had been unable to observe it at the regular time, because not enough priests had consecrated themselves and the people had not been gathered in Jerusalem.
</p>

<p>
<a id="30-4"></a> <b>4</b> This proposal pleased the king and the whole assembly. 
<a id="30-5"></a> <b>5</b> So they established a decree to circulate a proclamation throughout Israel, from Beersheba to Dan, that the people should come to keep the Passover of the LORD, the God of Israel, in Jerusalem. For they had not observed it as a nation as prescribed.
</p>

<p>
<a id="30-6"></a> <b>6</b> So the couriers went throughout Israel and Judah with letters from the king and his officials, which read:
</p>

<p>
“Children of Israel, return to the LORD, the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, so that He may return to those of you who remain, who have escaped the grasp of the kings of Assyria. 
<a id="30-7"></a> <b>7</b> Do not be like your fathers and brothers who were unfaithful to the LORD, the God of their fathers, so that He made them an object of horror, as you can see.
</p>

<p>
<a id="30-8"></a> <b>8</b> Now do not stiffen your necks as your fathers did. Submit to the LORD and come to His sanctuary, which He has consecrated forever. Serve the LORD your God, so that His fierce anger will turn away from you. 
<a id="30-9"></a> <b>9</b> For if you return to the LORD, your brothers and sons will receive mercy in the presence of their captors and will return to this land. For the LORD your God is gracious and merciful; He will not turn His face away from you if you return to Him.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="30-10"></a> <b>10</b> And the couriers traveled from city to city through the land of Ephraim and Manasseh as far as Zebulun; but the people scorned and mocked them. 
<a id="30-11"></a> <b>11</b> Nevertheless, some from Asher, Manasseh, and Zebulun humbled themselves and came to Jerusalem. 
<a id="30-12"></a> <b>12</b> Moreover, the power of God was on the people in Judah to give them one heart to obey the command of the king and his officials according to the word of the LORD.

<a id="30-13"></a> <b>13</b> In the second month, a very great assembly gathered in Jerusalem to celebrate the Feast of Unleavened Bread. 
<a id="30-14"></a> <b>14</b> They proceeded to remove the altars in Jerusalem and to take away the incense altars and throw them into the Kidron Valley. 
<a id="30-15"></a> <b>15</b> And on the fourteenth day of the second month they slaughtered the Passover lamb. The priests and Levites were ashamed, and they consecrated themselves and brought burnt offerings to the house of the LORD.
</p>

<p>
<a id="30-16"></a> <b>16</b> They stood at their prescribed posts, according to the Law of Moses the man of God. The priests sprinkled the blood, which they received from the hand of the Levites. 
<a id="30-17"></a> <b>17</b> Since there were many in the assembly who had not consecrated themselves, the Levites were in charge of slaughtering the Passover lambs for every unclean person to consecrate the lambs to the LORD.
</p>

<p>
<a id="30-18"></a> <b>18</b> A large number of the people&#x2014;many from Ephraim, Manasseh, Issachar, and Zebulun&#x2014;had not purified themselves, yet they ate the Passover, contrary to what was written.

<a id="30-19"></a> <b>19</b> who sets his heart on seeking God&#x2014;the LORD, the God of his fathers&#x2014;even if he is not cleansed according to the purification rules of the sanctuary.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="30-20"></a> <b>20</b> And the LORD heard Hezekiah and healed the people. 
<a id="30-21"></a> <b>21</b> The Israelites who were present in Jerusalem celebrated the Feast of Unleavened Bread for seven days with great joy, and the Levites and priests praised the LORD day after day, accompanied by loud instruments of praise to the LORD. 
<a id="30-22"></a> <b>22</b> And Hezekiah encouraged all the Levites who performed skillfully before the LORD. For seven days they ate their assigned portion, sacrificing fellowship offerings and giving thanks to the LORD, the God of their fathers.

<p>
<a id="30-23"></a> <b>23</b> The whole assembly agreed to observe seven more days, so they observed seven days with joy. 
<a id="30-24"></a> <b>24</b> For Hezekiah king of Judah contributed a thousand bulls and seven thousand sheep for the assembly, and the officials contributed a thousand bulls and ten thousand sheep for the assembly, and a great number of priests consecrated themselves.
</p>

<p>
<a id="30-25"></a> <b>25</b> Then the whole assembly of Judah rejoiced along with the priests and Levites and the whole assembly that had come from Israel, including the foreigners who had come from Israel and those who lived in Judah. 
<a id="30-26"></a> <b>26</b> So there was great rejoicing in Jerusalem, for nothing like this had happened there since the days of Solomon son of David king of Israel.

Then all the Israelites returned to their cities, each to his own property.
</p>

<p>
<a id="31-2"></a> <b>2</b> Hezekiah reestablished the divisions of the priests and Levites&#x2014;each of them according to their duties as priests or Levites&#x2014;for the burnt offerings and peace offerings, for ministry, for giving thanks, and for singing praises at the gates of the LORD&rsquo;s dwelling.

<a id="31-4"></a> <b>4</b> Moreover, he commanded the people living in Jerusalem to make a contribution for the priests and Levites so that they could devote themselves to the Law of the LORD.
</p>

<p>
<a id="31-5"></a> <b>5</b> As soon as the order went out, the Israelites generously provided the firstfruits of the grain, new wine, oil, and honey, and of all the produce of the field, and they brought in an abundance&#x2014;a tithe of everything. 
<a id="31-6"></a> <b>6</b> And the Israelites and Judahites who lived in the cities of Judah also brought a tithe of their herds and flocks and a tithe of the holy things consecrated to the LORD their God, and they laid them in large heaps.

<a id="31-13"></a> <b>13</b> Jehiel, Azaziah, Nahath, Asahel, Jerimoth, Jozabad, Eliel, Ismachiah, Mahath, and Benaiah were overseers under the authority of Conaniah and his brother Shimei, by appointment of King Hezekiah and of Azariah the chief official of the house of God.
</p>

<p>
<a id="31-14"></a> <b>14</b> Kore son of Imnah the Levite, the keeper of the East Gate, was in charge of the freewill offerings given to God, distributing the contributions to the LORD and the consecrated gifts. 
<a id="31-15"></a> <b>15</b> Under his authority, Eden, Miniamin, Jeshua, Shemaiah, Amariah, and Shecaniah faithfully distributed portions to their fellow priests in their cities, according to their divisions, old and young alike.

<p>
<a id="31-16"></a> <b>16</b> In addition, they distributed portions to the males registered by genealogy who were three years of age or older&#x2014;to all who would enter the house of the LORD for their daily duties for service in the responsibilities of their divisions&#x2014; 
<a id="31-17"></a> <b>17</b> and to the priests enrolled according to their families in the genealogy, as well as to the Levites twenty years of age or older, according to their duties and divisions.

<a id="31-20"></a> <b>20</b> So this is what Hezekiah did throughout Judah. He did what was good and upright and true before the LORD his God.

<a id="32-4"></a> <b>4</b> Many people assembled and stopped up all the springs and the stream that flowed through the land. “Why should the kings of Assyria come and find plenty of water?” they said.
</p>

<p>
<a id="32-5"></a> <b>5</b> Then Hezekiah worked resolutely to rebuild all the broken sections of the wall and to raise up towers on it. He also built an outer wall and reinforced the supporting terraces of the City of David, and he produced an abundance of weapons and shields.
</p>

<p>
<a id="32-6"></a> <b>6</b> Hezekiah appointed military commanders over the people and gathered the people in the square of the city gate. Then he encouraged them, saying,
<a id="32-7"></a> <b>7</b> “Be strong and courageous! Do not be afraid or discouraged before the king of Assyria and the vast army with him, for there is a greater One with us than with him.

<a id="32-11"></a> <b>11</b> Is not Hezekiah misleading you to give you over to death by famine and thirst when he says, ‘The LORD our God will deliver us from the hand of the king of Assyria?&rsquo; 
<a id="32-12"></a> <b>12</b> Did not Hezekiah himself remove His high places and His altars and say to Judah and Jerusalem, ‘You must worship before one altar, and on it you shall burn sacrifices&rsquo;?

<p>
<a id="32-13"></a> <b>13</b> Do you not know what I and my fathers have done to all the peoples of the lands? Have the gods of these nations ever been able to deliver their land from my hand? 
<a id="32-14"></a> <b>14</b> Who among all the gods of these nations that my fathers devoted to destruction has been able to deliver his people from my hand? How then can your God deliver you from my hand?

<a id="32-15"></a> <b>15</b> So now, do not let Hezekiah deceive you, and do not let him mislead you like this. Do not believe him, for no god of any nation or kingdom has been able to deliver his people from my hand or from the hand of my fathers. How much less will your God deliver you from my hand!”
</p>

<p>
<a id="32-16"></a> <b>16</b> And the servants of Sennacherib spoke further against the LORD God and against His servant Hezekiah. 
<a id="32-17"></a> <b>17</b> He also wrote letters mocking the LORD, the God of Israel, and saying against Him: “Just as the gods of the nations did not deliver their people from my hand, so the God of Hezekiah will not deliver His people from my hand.”

<p>
<a id="32-18"></a> <b>18</b> Then the Assyrians called out loudly in Hebrew to the people of Jerusalem who were on the wall, to frighten and terrify them in order to capture the city.

<a id="33-13"></a> <b>13</b> And when he prayed to Him, the LORD received his plea and heard his petition; so He brought him back to Jerusalem and to his kingdom. Then Manasseh knew that the LORD is God.
</p>

<p>
<a id="33-14"></a> <b>14</b> After this, Manasseh rebuilt the outer wall of the City of David from west of Gihon in the valley to the entrance of the Fish Gate, and he brought it around the hill of Ophel and heightened it considerably. He also stationed military commanders in all the fortified cities of Judah.

<p>
<a id="33-15"></a> <b>15</b> He removed the foreign gods and the idol from the house of the LORD, along with all the altars he had built on the temple mount and in Jerusalem, and he dumped them outside the city.

<a id="33-19"></a> <b>19</b> His prayer and how God received his plea, as well as all his sin and unfaithfulness, and the sites where he built high places and set up Asherah poles and idols before he humbled himself, they are indeed written in the Records of the Seers.

<p>
<a id="35-8"></a> <b>8</b> His officials also contributed willingly to the people and priests and Levites. Hilkiah, Zechariah, and Jehiel, the administrators of the house of God, gave the priests 2,600 Passover offerings and 300 bulls.

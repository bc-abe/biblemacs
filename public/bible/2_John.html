</p>

<p>
To the chosen lady and her children, whom I love in the truth&#x2014;and not I alone, but also all who know the truth&#x2014; 
<a id="1-2"></a> <b>2</b> because of the truth that abides in us and will be with us forever:
</p>

<p>
<a id="1-3"></a> <b>3</b> Grace, mercy, and peace from God the Father and from Jesus Christ, the Son of the Father, will be with us in truth and love.

<p>
<a id="1-4"></a> <b>4</b> I was overjoyed to find some of your children walking in the truth, just as the Father has commanded us. 
<a id="1-5"></a> <b>5</b> And now I urge you, dear lady&#x2014;not as a new commandment to you, but one we have had from the beginning&#x2014;that we love one another. 
<a id="1-6"></a> <b>6</b> And this is love, that we walk according to His commandments. This is the very commandment you have heard from the beginning, that you must walk in love.

<h3 id="org36be353">Beware of Deceivers</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org36be353">
<p>
<a id="1-7"></a> <b>7</b> For many deceivers have gone out into the world, refusing to confess the coming of Jesus Christ in the flesh. Any such person is the deceiver and the antichrist. 
<a id="1-8"></a> <b>8</b> Watch yourselves, so that you do not lose what we have worked for, but that you may be fully rewarded. 
<a id="1-9"></a> <b>9</b> Anyone who runs ahead without remaining in the teaching of Christ does not have God. Whoever remains in His teaching has both the Father and the Son.
</p>

<p>
<a id="1-10"></a> <b>10</b> If anyone comes to you but does not bring this teaching, do not receive him into your home or even greet him. 
<a id="1-11"></a> <b>11</b> Whoever greets such a person shares in his evil deeds.

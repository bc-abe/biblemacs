<p>
<a id="1-1"></a> After the death of Ahab, Moab rebelled against Israel.
</p>

<p>
<a id="1-2"></a> <b>2</b> Now Ahaziah had fallen through the lattice of his upper room in Samaria and injured himself. So he sent messengers and instructed them: “Go inquire of Baal-zebub, the god of Ekron, whether I will recover from this injury.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="1-3"></a> <b>3</b> But the angel of the LORD said to Elijah the Tishbite, “Go up to meet the messengers of the king of Samaria and ask them, ‘Is it because there is no God in Israel that you are on your way to inquire of Baal-zebub, the god of Ekron?&rsquo; 
<a id="1-4"></a> <b>4</b> Therefore this is what the LORD says: ‘You will not get up from the bed on which you are lying. You will surely die.&rsquo; ”
</p>

<p>
So Elijah departed.
</p>

<p>
<a id="1-5"></a> <b>5</b> When the messengers returned to the king, he asked them, “Why have you returned?”
</p>

<p>
<a id="1-6"></a> <b>6</b> They replied, “A man came up to meet us and said, ‘Go back to the king who sent you and tell him that this is what the LORD says: Is it because there is no God in Israel that you are sending these men to inquire of Baal-zebub, the god of Ekron? Therefore you will not get up from the bed on which you are lying. You will surely die.&rsquo; ”
</p>

<p>
<a id="1-7"></a> <b>7</b> The king asked them, “What sort of man came up to meet you and spoke these words to you?”
</p>

<p>
<a id="1-8"></a> <b>8</b> “He was a hairy man,” they answered, “with a leather belt around his waist.”
</p>

<p>
“It was Elijah the Tishbite,” said the king.
</p>

<p>
<a id="1-9"></a> <b>9</b> Then King Ahaziah sent to Elijah a captain with his company of fifty men. So the captain went up to Elijah, who was sitting on top of a hill, and said to him, “Man of God, the king declares, ‘Come down!&rsquo; ”
</p>

<p>
<a id="1-10"></a> <b>10</b> Elijah answered the captain, “If I am a man of God, may fire come down from heaven and consume you and your fifty men.”
</p>

<p>
And fire came down from heaven and consumed the captain and his fifty men.
</p>

<p>
<a id="1-11"></a> <b>11</b> So the king sent to Elijah another captain with his fifty men. And the captain said to Elijah, “Man of God, the king declares, ‘Come down at once!&rsquo; ”
</p>

<p>
<a id="1-12"></a> <b>12</b> Again Elijah replied, “If I am a man of God, may fire come down from heaven and consume you and your fifty men.”
</p>

<p>
And the fire of God came down from heaven and consumed the captain and his fifty men.
</p>

<p>
<a id="1-13"></a> <b>13</b> So the king sent a third captain with his fifty men. And the third captain went up, fell on his knees before Elijah, and begged him, “Man of God, may my life and the lives of these fifty servants please be precious in your sight. 
<a id="1-14"></a> <b>14</b> Behold, fire has come down from heaven and consumed the first two captains of fifty, with all their men. But now may my life be precious in your sight.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="1-15"></a> <b>15</b> Then the angel of the LORD said to Elijah, “Go down with him. Do not be afraid of him.”
</p>

<p>
So Elijah got up and went down with him to the king.
</p>

<p>
<a id="1-16"></a> <b>16</b> And Elijah said to King Ahaziah, “This is what the LORD says: Is there really no God in Israel for you to inquire of His word? Is that why you have sent messengers to inquire of Baal-zebub, the god of Ekron? Therefore you will not get up from the bed on which you are lying. You will surely die.”

<p>
<a id="1-17"></a> <b>17</b> So Ahaziah died according to the word of the LORD that Elijah had spoken. And since he had no son, Jehoram succeeded him in the second year of the reign of Jehoram son of Jehoshaphat over Judah.
</p>

<p>
<a id="1-18"></a> <b>18</b> As for the rest of the acts of Ahaziah, along with his accomplishments, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel?

</p>

<p>
<a id="2-1"></a> Shortly before the LORD took Elijah up to heaven in a whirlwind, Elijah and Elisha were on their way from Gilgal, 
<a id="2-2"></a> <b>2</b> and Elijah said to Elisha, “Please stay here, for the LORD has sent me on to Bethel.”
</p>

<p>
But Elisha replied, “As surely as the LORD lives and as you yourself live, I will not leave you.”
</p>

<p>
So they went down to Bethel.
</p>

<p>
<a id="2-3"></a> <b>3</b> Then the sons of the prophets at Bethel came out to Elisha and said, “Do you know that the LORD will take your master away from you today?”
</p>

<p>
“Yes, I know,” he replied. “Do not speak of it.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="2-4"></a> <b>4</b> And Elijah said to Elisha, “Please stay here, for the LORD has sent me on to Jericho.”
</p>

<p>
But Elisha replied, “As surely as the LORD lives and as you yourself live, I will not leave you.”
</p>

<p>
So they went to Jericho.
</p>

<p>
<a id="2-5"></a> <b>5</b> Then the sons of the prophets at Jericho came up to Elisha and said, “Do you know that the LORD will take your master away from you today?”
</p>

<p>
“Yes, I know,” he replied. “Do not speak of it.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="2-6"></a> <b>6</b> And Elijah said to Elisha, “Please stay here, for the LORD has sent me on to the Jordan.”
</p>

<p>
But Elisha replied, “As surely as the LORD lives and as you yourself live, I will not leave you.”
</p>

<p>
So the two of them went on.
</p>

<p>
<a id="2-7"></a> <b>7</b> Then a company of fifty of the sons of the prophets went and stood at a distance, facing Elijah and Elisha as the two of them stood by the Jordan. 
<a id="2-8"></a> <b>8</b> And Elijah took his cloak, rolled it up, and struck the waters, which parted to the right and to the left, so that the two of them crossed over on dry ground.
</p>

<p>
<a id="2-9"></a> <b>9</b> After they had crossed over, Elijah said to Elisha, “Tell me, what can I do for you before I am taken away from you?”
</p>

<p>
“Please, let me inherit a double portion of your spirit,” Elisha replied.
</p>

<p>
<a id="2-10"></a> <b>10</b> “You have requested a difficult thing,” said Elijah. “Nevertheless, if you see me as I am taken from you, it will be yours. But if not, then it will not be so.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="2-11"></a> <b>11</b> As they were walking along and talking together, suddenly a chariot of fire with horses of fire appeared and separated the two of them, and Elijah went up into heaven in a whirlwind.
</p>

<p>
<a id="2-12"></a> <b>12</b> As Elisha watched, he cried out, “My father, my father, the chariots and horsemen of Israel!” And he saw Elijah no more. So taking hold of his own clothes, he tore them in two.
</p>

<p>
<a id="2-13"></a> <b>13</b> Elisha also picked up the cloak that had fallen from Elijah, and he went back and stood on the bank of the Jordan. 
<a id="2-14"></a> <b>14</b> Then he took the cloak of Elijah that had fallen from him and struck the waters. “Where now is the LORD, the God of Elijah?” he asked.
</p>

<p>
And when he had struck the waters, they parted to the right and to the left, and Elisha crossed over.
</p>

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgbbf7a1d">
<p>
<a id="2-15"></a> <b>15</b> When the sons of the prophets who were facing him from Jericho saw what had happened, they said, “The spirit of Elijah rests on Elisha.” And they went to meet him and bowed down to the ground before him.
</p>

<p>
<a id="2-16"></a> <b>16</b> “Look now,” they said to Elisha, “we your servants have fifty valiant men. Please let them go and search for your master. Perhaps the Spirit of the LORD has taken him up and put him on one of the mountains or in one of the valleys.”
</p>

<p>
“Do not send them,” Elisha replied.
</p>

<p>
<a id="2-17"></a> <b>17</b> But when they pressed him to the point of embarrassment, he said, “Send them.”
</p>

<p>
And they sent fifty men, who searched for three days but did not find Elijah.
</p>

<p>
<a id="2-18"></a> <b>18</b> When they returned to Elisha, who was staying in Jericho, he said to them, “Didn&rsquo;t I tell you not to go?”

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgec2b25e">
<p>
<a id="2-19"></a> <b>19</b> Then the men of the city said to Elisha, “Please note, our lord, that the city&rsquo;s location is good, as you can see. But the water is bad and the land is unfruitful.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="2-20"></a> <b>20</b> “Bring me a new bowl,” he replied, “and put some salt in it.”
</p>

<p>
So they brought it to him, 
<a id="2-21"></a> <b>21</b> and Elisha went out to the spring, cast the salt into it, and said, “This is what the LORD says: ‘I have healed this water. No longer will it cause death or unfruitfulness.&rsquo; ”
</p>

<p>
<a id="2-22"></a> <b>22</b> And the waters there have been healthy to this day, according to the word spoken by Elisha.

<p>
<a id="2-23"></a> <b>23</b> From there, Elisha went up to Bethel, and as he was walking up the road, a group of boys came out of the city and jeered at him, chanting, “Go up, you baldhead! Go up, you baldhead!”
</p>

<p>
<a id="2-24"></a> <b>24</b> Then he turned around, looked at them, and called down a curse on them in the name of the LORD.
</p>

<p>
Suddenly two female bears came out of the woods and mauled forty-two of the boys.
</p>

<p>
<a id="2-25"></a> <b>25</b> And Elisha went on to Mount Carmel, and from there he returned to Samaria.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org0954727">

</p>

<p>
<a id="3-1"></a> In the eighteenth year of Jehoshaphat&rsquo;s reign over Judah, Jehoram son of Ahab became king of Israel, and he reigned in Samaria twelve years. 
<a id="3-2"></a> <b>2</b> And he did evil in the sight of the LORD, but not as his father and mother had done. He removed the sacred pillar of Baal that his father had made.
</p>

<p>
<a id="3-3"></a> <b>3</b> Nevertheless, he clung to the sins that Jeroboam son of Nebat had caused Israel to commit; he did not turn away from them.
</p>

<p>
<a id="3-4"></a> <b>4</b> Now Mesha king of Moab was a sheep breeder, and he would render to the king of Israel a hundred thousand lambs and the wool of a hundred thousand rams. 
<a id="3-5"></a> <b>5</b> But after the death of Ahab, the king of Moab rebelled against the king of Israel. 
<a id="3-6"></a> <b>6</b> So at that time King Jehoram set out from Samaria and mobilized all Israel. 
<a id="3-7"></a> <b>7</b> And he sent a message to Jehoshaphat king of Judah: “The king of Moab has rebelled against me. Will you go with me to fight against Moab?”
</p>

<p>
“I will go,” replied Jehoshaphat. “I am like you, my people are your people, and my horses are your horses.” 
<a id="3-8"></a> <b>8</b> Then he asked, “Which way shall we go up?”
</p>

<p>
“By way of the Desert of Edom,” replied Joram.
</p>

<p>
<a id="3-9"></a> <b>9</b> So the king of Israel, the king of Judah, and the king of Edom set out, and after they had traveled a roundabout route for seven days, they had no water for their army or for their animals.
</p>

<p>
<a id="3-10"></a> <b>10</b> “Alas,” said the king of Israel, “for the LORD has summoned these three kings to deliver them into the hand of Moab!”
</p>

<p>
<a id="3-11"></a> <b>11</b> But Jehoshaphat asked, “Is there no prophet of the LORD here? Let us inquire of the LORD through him.”
</p>

<p>
And one of the servants of the king of Israel answered, “Elisha son of Shaphat is here. He used to pour water on the hands of Elijah.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="3-12"></a> <b>12</b> Jehoshaphat affirmed, “The word of the LORD is with him.” So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat and the king of Edom went down to him.
</p>

<p>
<a id="3-13"></a> <b>13</b> Elisha, however, said to the king of Israel, “What have we to do with each other? Go to the prophets of your father and of your mother!”
</p>

<p>
“No,” replied the king of Israel, “for it is the LORD who has summoned these three kings to deliver them into the hand of Moab.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="3-14"></a> <b>14</b> Then Elisha said, “As surely as the LORD of Hosts lives, before whom I stand, were it not for my regard for the presence of Jehoshaphat king of Judah, I would not look at you or acknowledge you. 
<a id="3-15"></a> <b>15</b> But now, bring me a harpist.”
</p>

<p>
And while the harpist played, the hand of the LORD came upon Elisha 
<a id="3-16"></a> <b>16</b> and he said, “This is what the LORD says: ‘Dig this valley full of ditches.&rsquo; 
<a id="3-17"></a> <b>17</b> For the LORD says, ‘You will not see wind or rain, but the valley will be filled with water, and you will drink&#x2014;you and your cattle and your animals.&rsquo; 
<a id="3-18"></a> <b>18</b> This is a simple matter in the sight of the LORD, and He will also deliver the Moabites into your hand. 
<a id="3-19"></a> <b>19</b> And you shall attack every fortified city and every city of importance. You shall cut down every good tree, stop up every spring, and ruin every good field with stones.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="3-20"></a> <b>20</b> The next morning, at the time of the morning sacrifice, water suddenly flowed from the direction of Edom and filled the land.
</p>

<p>
<a id="3-21"></a> <b>21</b> Now all the Moabites had heard that the kings had come up to fight against them. So all who could bear arms, young and old, were summoned and stationed at the border. 
<a id="3-22"></a> <b>22</b> When they got up early in the morning, the sun was shining on the water, and it looked as red as blood to the Moabites across the way.
</p>

<p>
<a id="3-23"></a> <b>23</b> “This is blood!” they exclaimed. “The kings have clashed swords and slaughtered one another. Now to the plunder, Moab!”
</p>

<p>
<a id="3-24"></a> <b>24</b> But when the Moabites came to the camp of Israel, the Israelites rose up and attacked them, and they fled before them. So the Israelites invaded their land and struck down the Moabites. 
<a id="3-25"></a> <b>25</b> They destroyed the cities, and each man threw stones on every good field until it was covered. They stopped up every spring and cut down every good tree. Only Kir-haraseth was left with stones in place, but men with slings surrounded it and attacked it as well.
</p>

<p>
<a id="3-26"></a> <b>26</b> When the king of Moab saw that the battle was too fierce for him, he took with him seven hundred swordsmen to break through to the king of Edom, but they could not prevail. 
<a id="3-27"></a> <b>27</b> So he took his firstborn son, who was to succeed him, and offered him as a burnt offering on the city wall.
</p>

<p>
And there was great fury against the Israelites, so they withdrew and returned to their own land.

<p>
<a id="4-1"></a> Now the wife of one of the sons of the prophets cried out to Elisha, “Your servant, my husband, is dead, and you know that your servant feared the LORD. And now his creditor is coming to take my two children as his slaves!”
</p>

<p>
<a id="4-2"></a> <b>2</b> “How can I help you?” asked Elisha. “Tell me, what do you have in the house?”
</p>

<p>
She answered, “Your servant has nothing in the house but a jar of oil.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="4-3"></a> <b>3</b> “Go,” said Elisha, “borrow jars, even empty ones, from all your neighbors. Do not gather just a few. 
<a id="4-4"></a> <b>4</b> Then go inside, shut the door behind you and your sons, and pour oil into all these jars, setting the full ones aside.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="4-5"></a> <b>5</b> So she left him, and after she had shut the door behind her and her sons, they kept bringing jars to her, and she kept pouring. 
<a id="4-6"></a> <b>6</b> When all the jars were full, she said to her son, “Bring me another.”
</p>

<p>
But he replied, “There are no more jars.” Then the oil stopped flowing.
</p>

<p>
<a id="4-7"></a> <b>7</b> She went and told the man of God, and he said, “Go, sell the oil, and pay your debt. Then you and your sons can live on the remainder.”

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org2163106">
<p>
<a id="4-8"></a> <b>8</b> One day Elisha went to Shunem, and a prominent woman who lived there persuaded him to have a meal. So whenever he would pass by, he would stop there to eat.
</p>

<p>
<a id="4-9"></a> <b>9</b> Then the woman said to her husband, “Behold, now I know that the one who often comes our way is a holy man of God. 
<a id="4-10"></a> <b>10</b> Please let us make a small room upstairs and put in it a bed, a table, a chair, and a lamp for him. Then when he comes to us, he can stay there.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="4-11"></a> <b>11</b> One day Elisha came to visit and went to his upper room to lie down. 
<a id="4-12"></a> <b>12</b> And he said to Gehazi his servant, “Call the Shunammite woman.”
</p>

<p>
And when he had called her, she stood before him, 
<a id="4-13"></a> <b>13</b> and Elisha said to Gehazi, “Now tell her, ‘Look, you have gone to all this trouble for us. What can we do for you? Can we speak on your behalf to the king or the commander of the army?&rsquo; ”
</p>

<p>
“I have a home among my own people,” she replied.
</p>

<p>
<a id="4-14"></a> <b>14</b> So he asked, “Then what should be done for her?”
</p>

<p>
“Well, she has no son,” Gehazi replied, “and her husband is old.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="4-15"></a> <b>15</b> “Call her,” said Elisha.
</p>

<p>
So Gehazi called her, and she stood in the doorway. 
<a id="4-16"></a> <b>16</b> And Elisha declared, “At this time next year, you will hold a son in your arms.”
</p>

<p>
“No, my lord,” she said. “Do not lie to your maidservant, O man of God.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="4-17"></a> <b>17</b> But the woman did conceive, and at that time the next year she gave birth to a son, just as Elisha had told her.

<p>
<a id="4-19"></a> <b>19</b> “My head! My head!” he complained to his father.

<a id="4-21"></a> <b>21</b> And she went up and laid him on the bed of the man of God. Then she shut the door and went out.

<p>
<a id="4-22"></a> <b>22</b> And the woman called her husband and said, “Please send me one of the servants and one of the donkeys, that I may go quickly to the man of God and return.”

<a id="4-23"></a> <b>23</b> “Why would you go to him today?” he replied. “It is not a New Moon or a Sabbath.”

“Everything is all right,” she said.

<a id="4-25"></a> <b>25</b> So she set out and went to the man of God at Mount Carmel.

<p>
<a id="4-28"></a> <b>28</b> Then she said, “Did I ask you for a son, my lord? Didn&rsquo;t I say, ‘Do not deceive me?&rsquo; ”

<a id="4-29"></a> <b>29</b> So Elisha said to Gehazi, “Tie up your garment, take my staff in your hand, and go! If you meet anyone, do not greet him, and if anyone greets you, do not answer him. Then lay my staff on the boy&rsquo;s face.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="4-30"></a> <b>30</b> And the mother of the boy said, “As surely as the LORD lives and as you yourself live, I will not leave you.” So he got up and followed her.
</p>

<p>
<a id="4-31"></a> <b>31</b> Gehazi went on ahead of them and laid the staff on the boy&rsquo;s face, but there was no sound or response. So he went back to meet Elisha and told him, “The boy has not awakened.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="4-32"></a> <b>32</b> When Elisha reached the house, there was the boy lying dead on his bed. 
<a id="4-33"></a> <b>33</b> So he went in, closed the door behind the two of them, and prayed to the LORD.
</p>

<p>
<a id="4-34"></a> <b>34</b> Then Elisha got on the bed and lay on the boy, mouth to mouth, eye to eye, and hand to hand. As he stretched himself out over him, the boy&rsquo;s body became warm. 
<a id="4-35"></a> <b>35</b> Elisha turned away and paced back and forth across the room. Then he got on the bed and stretched himself out over the boy again, and the boy sneezed seven times and opened his eyes.
</p>

<p>
<a id="4-36"></a> <b>36</b> Elisha summoned Gehazi and said, “Call the Shunammite woman.” So he called her and she came.
</p>

<p>
Then Elisha said, “Pick up your son.”
</p>

<a id="4-39"></a> <b>39</b> One of them went out to the field to gather herbs, and he found a wild vine from which he gathered as many wild gourds as his garment could hold. Then he came back and cut them up into the pot of stew, though no one knew what they were.

<p>
<a id="5-1"></a> Now Naaman, the commander of the army of the king of Aram, was a great man in his master&rsquo;s sight and highly regarded, for through him the LORD had given victory to Aram. And he was a mighty man of valor, but he was a leper.
</p>

<p>
<a id="5-2"></a> <b>2</b> At this time the Arameans had gone out in bands and had taken a young girl from the land of Israel, and she was serving Naaman&rsquo;s wife. 
<a id="5-3"></a> <b>3</b> She said to her mistress, “If only my master would go to the prophet who is in Samaria, he would cure him of his leprosy.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="5-4"></a> <b>4</b> And Naaman went and told his master what the girl from the land of Israel had said.
</p>

<p>
<a id="5-5"></a> <b>5</b> “Go now,” said the king of Aram, “and I will send you with a letter to the king of Israel.”
</p>

<p>
So Naaman departed, taking with him ten talents of silver, six thousand shekels of gold, and ten sets of clothing.
</p>

<p>
<a id="5-6"></a> <b>6</b> And the letter that he took to the king of Israel stated: “With this letter I am sending my servant Naaman, so that you may cure him of his leprosy.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="5-7"></a> <b>7</b> When the king of Israel read the letter, he tore his clothes and asked, “Am I God, killing and giving life, that this man expects me to cure a leper? Surely you can see that he is seeking a quarrel with me!”
</p>

<p>
<a id="5-8"></a> <b>8</b> Now when Elisha the man of God heard that the king of Israel had torn his clothes, he sent a message to the king: “Why have you torn your clothes? Please let the man come to me, and he will know that there is a prophet in Israel.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="5-9"></a> <b>9</b> So Naaman came with his horses and chariots and stood at the door of Elisha&rsquo;s house.
</p>

<p>
<a id="5-10"></a> <b>10</b> Then Elisha sent him a messenger, who said, “Go and wash yourself seven times in the Jordan, and your flesh will be restored, and you will be clean.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="5-11"></a> <b>11</b> But Naaman went away angry, saying, “I thought that he would surely come out, stand and call on the name of the LORD his God, and wave his hand over the spot to cure my leprosy. 
<a id="5-12"></a> <b>12</b> Are not the Abanah and Pharpar, the rivers of Damascus, better than all the waters of Israel? Could I not have washed in them and been cleansed?” So he turned and went away in a rage.
</p>

<p>
<a id="5-13"></a> <b>13</b> Naaman&rsquo;s servants, however, approached him and said, “My father, if the prophet had told you to do some great thing, would you not have done it? How much more, then, when he tells you, ‘Wash and be cleansed&rsquo;?”
</p>

<p>
<a id="5-14"></a> <b>14</b> So Naaman went down and dipped himself in the Jordan seven times, according to the word of the man of God, and his flesh was restored and became like that of a little child, and he was clean.

</p>

<p>
<a id="5-16"></a> <b>16</b> But Elisha replied, “As surely as the LORD lives, before whom I stand, I will not accept it.” And although Naaman urged him to accept it, he refused.
</p>

<p>
<a id="5-17"></a> <b>17</b> “If you will not,” said Naaman, “please let me, your servant, be given as much soil as a pair of mules can carry. For your servant will never again make a burnt offering or a sacrifice to any other god but the LORD. 
<a id="5-18"></a> <b>18</b> Yet may the LORD forgive your servant this one thing: When my master goes into the temple of Rimmon to worship there, and he leans on my arm, and I bow down in the temple of Rimmon, may the LORD forgive your servant in this matter.”

<a id="5-19"></a> <b>19</b> “Go in peace,” said Elisha.

But after Naaman had traveled a short distance,

</p>

<p>
<a id="5-21"></a> <b>21</b> So Gehazi pursued Naaman. And when Naaman saw him running toward him, he got down from the chariot to meet him and asked, “Is everything all right?”
</p>

<p>
<a id="5-22"></a> <b>22</b> “Everything is all right,” Gehazi replied. “My master has sent me to say, ‘I have just now discovered that two young men from the sons of the prophets have come to me from the hill country of Ephraim. Please give them a talent of silver and two sets of clothing.&rsquo; ”
</p>

<p>
<a id="5-23"></a> <b>23</b> But Naaman insisted, “Please, take two talents.” And he urged Gehazi to accept them. Then he tied up two talents of silver in two bags along with two sets of clothing and gave them to two of his servants, who carried them ahead of Gehazi.
</p>

<p>
<a id="5-24"></a> <b>24</b> When Gehazi came to the hill, he took the gifts from the servants and stored them in the house. Then he dismissed the men, and they departed.

<p>
<a id="5-25"></a> <b>25</b> When Gehazi went in and stood before his master, Elisha asked him, “Gehazi, where have you been?”

<p>
“Your servant did not go anywhere,” he replied.
</p>

<p>
<a id="5-26"></a> <b>26</b> But Elisha questioned him, “Did not my spirit go with you when the man got down from his chariot to meet you? Is this the time to accept money and clothing, olive groves and vineyards, sheep and oxen, menservants and maidservants? 
<a id="5-27"></a> <b>27</b> Therefore, the leprosy of Naaman will cling to you and your descendants forever!”

<p>
<a id="6-9"></a> <b>9</b> Then the man of God sent word to the king of Israel: “Be careful passing by this place, for the Arameans are going down there.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="6-10"></a> <b>10</b> So the king of Israel sent word to the place the man of God had pointed out. Time and again Elisha warned the king, so that he was on his guard in such places. 
<a id="6-11"></a> <b>11</b> For this reason the king of Aram became enraged and called his servants to demand of them, “Tell me, which one of us is on the side of the king of Israel?”
</p>

<p>
<a id="6-12"></a> <b>12</b> But one of his servants replied, “No one, my lord the king. For Elisha, the prophet in Israel, tells the king of Israel the very words you speak in your bedroom.”

</p>

<p>
<a id="6-16"></a> <b>16</b> “Do not be afraid,” Elisha answered, “for those who are with us are more than those who are with them.”

<p>
<a id="6-17"></a> <b>17</b> Then Elisha prayed, “O LORD, please open his eyes that he may see.”

<p>
And the LORD opened the eyes of the young man, and he saw that the hills were full of horses and chariots of fire all around Elisha.
</p>

<p>
<a id="6-18"></a> <b>18</b> As the Arameans came down against him, Elisha prayed to the LORD, “Please strike these people with blindness.” So He struck them with blindness, according to the word of Elisha.
</p>

<p>
<a id="6-19"></a> <b>19</b> And Elisha told them, “This is not the way, and this is not the city. Follow me, and I will take you to the man you are seeking.” And he led them to Samaria.

<p>
<a id="6-20"></a> <b>20</b> When they had entered Samaria, Elisha said, “O LORD, open the eyes of these men that they may see.”

Then the LORD opened their eyes, and they looked around and discovered that they were in Samaria.

<p>
<a id="6-21"></a> <b>21</b> And when the king of Israel saw them, he asked Elisha, “My father, shall I kill them? Shall I kill them?”

And she answered, “This woman said to me, ‘Give up your son, that we may eat him, and tomorrow we will eat my son.&rsquo; 
<a id="6-29"></a> <b>29</b> So we boiled my son and ate him, and the next day I said to her, ‘Give up your son, that we may eat him.&rsquo; But she had hidden her son.”

<a id="8-5"></a> <b>5</b> And Gehazi was telling the king how Elisha had brought the dead back to life. Just then the woman whose son Elisha had revived came to appeal to the king for her house and her land.

<p>
“Because I know the evil you will do to the Israelites,” Elisha replied. “You will set fire to their fortresses, kill their young men with the sword, dash their little ones to pieces, and rip open their pregnant women.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="8-13"></a> <b>13</b> “But how could your servant, a mere dog, do such a monstrous thing?” said Hazael.

“For which of us?” asked Jehu.

<p>
“For you, commander,” he replied.

<p>
<a id="9-6"></a> <b>6</b> So Jehu got up and went into the house, where the young prophet poured the oil on his head and declared, “This is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says: ‘I anoint you king over the LORD&rsquo;s people Israel.

Then the young prophet opened the door and ran.

“You know his kind and their babble,” he replied.

<a id="9-12"></a> <b>12</b> “That is a lie!” they said. “Tell us now!”

<a id="9-14"></a> <b>14</b> Thus Jehu son of Jehoshaphat, the son of Nimshi, conspired against Joram.
</p>

<p>
(Now Joram and all Israel had been defending Ramoth-gilead against Hazael king of Aram, 
<a id="9-15"></a> <b>15</b> but King Joram had returned to Jezreel to recover from the wounds he had suffered at the hands of the Arameans in the battle against Hazael their king.)
</p>

<p>
So Jehu said, “If you commanders wish to make me king, then do not let anyone escape from the city to go and tell it in Jezreel.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="9-16"></a> <b>16</b> Then Jehu got into his chariot and went to Jezreel, because Joram was laid up there and Ahaziah king of Judah had gone down to see him.
</p>

<p>
<a id="9-17"></a> <b>17</b> Now the watchman standing on the tower in Jezreel saw Jehu&rsquo;s troops approaching, and he called out, “I see a company of troops!”

“Choose a rider,” Joram commanded. “Send him out to meet them and ask, ‘Have you come in peace?&rsquo; ”

<p>
<a id="9-18"></a> <b>18</b> So a horseman rode off to meet Jehu and said, “This is what the king asks: ‘Have you come in peace?&rsquo; ”

“What do you know about peace?” Jehu replied. “Fall in behind me.”
</p>

<p>
And the watchman reported, “The messenger reached them, but he is not coming back.”

“What do you know about peace?” Jehu replied. “Fall in behind me.”

</p>

<p>
<a id="9-21"></a> <b>21</b> “Harness!” Joram shouted, and they harnessed his chariot.
</p>

<p>
Then Joram king of Israel and Ahaziah king of Judah set out, each in his own chariot, and met Jehu on the property of Naboth the Jezreelite.
</p>

<p>
<a id="9-22"></a> <b>22</b> When Joram saw Jehu, he asked, “Have you come in peace, Jehu?”
</p>

<p>
“How can there be peace,” he replied, “as long as the idolatry and witchcraft of your mother Jezebel abound?”
</p>

<p>
<a id="9-23"></a> <b>23</b> Joram turned around and fled, calling out to Ahaziah, “Treachery, Ahaziah!”
</p>

<p>
<a id="9-24"></a> <b>24</b> Then Jehu drew his bow and shot Joram between the shoulders. The arrow pierced his heart, and he slumped down in his chariot.
</p>

<p>
<a id="9-25"></a> <b>25</b> And Jehu said to Bidkar his officer, “Pick him up and throw him into the field of Naboth the Jezreelite. For remember that when you and I were riding together behind his father Ahab, the LORD lifted up this burden against him: 26‘As surely as I saw the blood of Naboth and the blood of his sons yesterday, declares the LORD, so will I repay you on this plot of ground, declares the LORD.&rsquo; Now then, according to the word of the LORD, pick him up and throw him on the plot of ground.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="9-27"></a> <b>27</b> When King Ahaziah of Judah saw this, he fled up the road toward Beth-haggan.
</p>

<p>
And Jehu pursued him, shouting, “Shoot him too!”
</p>

<p>
So they shot Ahaziah in his chariot on the Ascent of Gur, near Ibleam, and he fled to Megiddo and died there.

<p>
<a id="9-32"></a> <b>32</b> He looked up at the window and called out, “Who is on my side? Who?”

<a id="9-33"></a> <b>33</b> “Throw her down!” yelled Jehu.

<p>
So they threw her down, and her blood splattered on the wall and on the horses as they trampled her underfoot.
</p>

<p>
<a id="9-34"></a> <b>34</b> Then Jehu went in and ate and drank. “Take care of this cursed woman,” he said, “and bury her, for she was the daughter of a king.”

<p>
<a id="10-1"></a> Now Ahab had seventy sons in Samaria. So Jehu wrote letters and sent them to Samaria to the officials of Jezreel, to the elders, and to the guardians of the sons of Ahab, saying:
<a id="10-2"></a> <b>2</b> “When this letter arrives, since your master&rsquo;s sons are with you and you have chariots and horses, a fortified city and weaponry, 
<a id="10-3"></a> <b>3</b> select the best and most worthy son of your master, set him on his father&rsquo;s throne, and fight for your master&rsquo;s house.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="10-4"></a> <b>4</b> But they were terrified and reasoned, “If two kings could not stand against him, how can we?”
</p>

<p>
<a id="10-5"></a> <b>5</b> So the palace administrator, the overseer of the city, the elders, and the guardians sent a message to Jehu: “We are your servants, and we will do whatever you say. We will not make anyone king. Do whatever is good in your sight.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="10-6"></a> <b>6</b> Then Jehu wrote them a second letter and said: “If you are on my side, and if you will obey me, then bring the heads of your master&rsquo;s sons to me at Jezreel by this time tomorrow.”
</p>

<p>
Now the sons of the king, seventy in all, were being brought up by the leading men of the city. 
<a id="10-7"></a> <b>7</b> And when the letter arrived, they took the sons of the king and slaughtered all seventy of them. They put their heads in baskets and sent them to Jehu at Jezreel.
</p>

<p>
<a id="10-8"></a> <b>8</b> When the messenger arrived, he told Jehu, “They have brought the heads of the sons of the king.”
</p>

<p>
And Jehu ordered, “Pile them in two heaps at the entrance of the gate until morning.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="10-9"></a> <b>9</b> The next morning, Jehu went out and stood before all the people and said, “You are innocent. It was I who conspired against my master and killed him. But who killed all these? 
<a id="10-10"></a> <b>10</b> Know, then, that not a word the LORD has spoken against the house of Ahab will fail, for the LORD has done what He promised through His servant Elijah.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="10-11"></a> <b>11</b> So Jehu killed everyone in Jezreel who remained of the house of Ahab, as well as all his great men and close friends and priests, leaving him without a single survivor.
</p>

<p>
<a id="10-12"></a> <b>12</b> Then Jehu set out toward Samaria. At Beth-eked of the Shepherds, 
<a id="10-13"></a> <b>13</b> Jehu met some relatives of Ahaziah king of Judah and asked, “Who are you?”
</p>

<p>
“We are relatives of Ahaziah,” they answered, “and we have come down to greet the sons of the king and of the queen mother.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="10-14"></a> <b>14</b> Then Jehu ordered, “Take them alive.” So his men took them alive, then slaughtered them at the well of Beth-eked&#x2014;forty-two men. He spared none of them.
</p>

<p>
<a id="10-15"></a> <b>15</b> When he left there, he found Jehonadab son of Rechab, who was coming to meet him. Jehu greeted him and asked, “Is your heart as true to mine as my heart is to yours?”
</p>

<p>
“It is!” Jehonadab replied.
</p>

<p>
“If it is,” said Jehu, “give me your hand.”
</p>

<p>
So he gave him his hand, and Jehu helped him into his chariot, 
<a id="10-16"></a> <b>16</b> saying, “Come with me and see my zeal for the LORD!” So he had him ride in his chariot.
</p>

<p>

<p>
But Jehu was acting deceptively in order to destroy the servants of Baal.
</p>

<p>
<a id="10-20"></a> <b>20</b> And Jehu commanded, “Proclaim a solemn assembly for Baal.” So they announced it.
</p>

<p>
<a id="10-21"></a> <b>21</b> Then Jehu sent word throughout Israel, and all the servants of Baal came; there was not a man who failed to show. They entered the temple of Baal, and it was filled from end to end.

<p>
<a id="10-23"></a> <b>23</b> Next, Jehu and Jehonadab son of Rechab entered the temple of Baal, and Jehu said to the servants of Baal, “Look around to see that there are no servants of the LORD here among you&#x2014;only servants of Baal.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="10-24"></a> <b>24</b> And they went in to offer sacrifices and burnt offerings. Now Jehu had stationed eighty men outside and warned them, “If anyone allows one of the men I am delivering into your hands to escape, he will forfeit his life for theirs.”

<p>
<a id="10-25"></a> <b>25</b> When he had finished making the burnt offering, Jehu said to the guards and officers, “Go in and kill them. Do not let anyone out.”

So the guards and officers put them to the sword, threw the bodies out, and went into the inner room of the temple of Baal.

<p>
<a id="17-6"></a> <b>6</b> In the ninth year of Hoshea, the king of Assyria captured Samaria and carried away the Israelites to Assyria, where he settled them in Halah, in Gozan by the Habor River, and in the cities of the Medes.
</p>

<p>
<a id="17-7"></a> <b>7</b> All this happened because the people of Israel had sinned against the LORD their God, who had brought them out of the land of Egypt from under the hand of Pharaoh king of Egypt. They had worshiped other gods 
<a id="17-8"></a> <b>8</b> and walked in the customs of the nations that the LORD had driven out before the Israelites, as well as in the practices introduced by the kings of Israel.
</p>

<p>
<a id="17-9"></a> <b>9</b> The Israelites secretly did things against the LORD their God that were not right. From watchtower to fortified city, they built high places in all their cities. 
<a id="17-10"></a> <b>10</b> They set up for themselves sacred pillars and Asherah poles on every high hill and under every green tree. 
<a id="17-11"></a> <b>11</b> They burned incense on all the high places like the nations that the LORD had driven out before them. They did wicked things, provoking the LORD to anger. 
<a id="17-12"></a> <b>12</b> They served idols, although the LORD had told them, “You shall not do this thing.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="17-13"></a> <b>13</b> Yet through all His prophets and seers, the LORD warned Israel and Judah, saying, “Turn from your wicked ways and keep My commandments and statutes, according to the entire Law that I commanded your fathers and delivered to you through My servants the prophets.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="17-14"></a> <b>14</b> But they would not listen, and they stiffened their necks like their fathers, who did not believe the LORD their God. 
<a id="17-15"></a> <b>15</b> They rejected His statutes and the covenant He had made with their fathers, as well as the decrees He had given them. They pursued worthless idols and themselves became worthless, going after the surrounding nations that the LORD had commanded them not to imitate.
</p>

<p>
<a id="17-16"></a> <b>16</b> They abandoned all the commandments of the LORD their God and made for themselves two cast idols of calves and an Asherah pole. They bowed down to all the host of heaven and served Baal. 
<a id="17-17"></a> <b>17</b> They sacrificed their sons and daughters in the fire and practiced divination and soothsaying. They devoted themselves to doing evil in the sight of the LORD, provoking Him to anger.
</p>

<p>
<a id="17-18"></a> <b>18</b> So the LORD was very angry with Israel, and He removed them from His presence. Only the tribe of Judah remained, 
<a id="17-19"></a> <b>19</b> and even Judah did not keep the commandments of the LORD their God, but lived according to the customs Israel had introduced. 
<a id="17-20"></a> <b>20</b> So the LORD rejected all the descendants of Israel. He afflicted them and delivered them into the hands of plunderers, until He had banished them from His presence.
</p>

<p>
<a id="17-21"></a> <b>21</b> When the LORD had torn Israel away from the house of David, they made Jeroboam son of Nebat king, and Jeroboam led Israel away from following the LORD and caused them to commit a great sin. 
<a id="17-22"></a> <b>22</b> The Israelites persisted in all the sins that Jeroboam had committed and did not turn away from them. 
<a id="17-23"></a> <b>23</b> Finally, the LORD removed Israel from His presence, as He had declared through all His servants the prophets. So Israel was exiled from their homeland into Assyria, where they are to this day.

</p>

<p>
<a id="17-25"></a> <b>25</b> Now when the settlers first lived there, they did not worship the LORD, so He sent lions among them, which killed some of them. 
<a id="17-26"></a> <b>26</b> So they spoke to the king of Assyria, saying, “The peoples that you have removed and placed in the cities of Samaria do not know the requirements of the God of the land. Because of this, He has sent lions among them, which are indeed killing them off.”

<p>
<a id="17-27"></a> <b>27</b> Then the king of Assyria commanded: “Send back one of the priests you carried off from Samaria, and have him go back to live there and teach the requirements of the God of the land.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="17-28"></a> <b>28</b> Thus one of the priests they had carried away came and lived in Bethel, and he began to teach them how they should worship the LORD.
</p>

<p>
<a id="17-29"></a> <b>29</b> Nevertheless, the people of each nation continued to make their own gods in the cities where they had settled, and they set them up in the shrines that the people of Samaria had made on the high places. 
<a id="17-30"></a> <b>30</b> The men of Babylon made Succoth-benoth, the men of Cuth made Nergal, the men of Hamath made Ashima, 
<a id="17-31"></a> <b>31</b> the Avvites made Nibhaz and Tartak, and the Sepharvites burned their children in the fire to Adrammelech and Anammelech the gods of Sepharvaim.
</p>

<p>
<a id="17-32"></a> <b>32</b> So the new residents worshiped the LORD, but they also appointed for themselves priests of all sorts to serve in the shrines of the high places. 
<a id="17-33"></a> <b>33</b> They worshiped the LORD, but they also served their own gods according to the customs of the nations from which they had been carried away.
</p>

<p>
<a id="17-34"></a> <b>34</b> To this day they are still practicing their former customs. None of them worship the LORD or observe the statutes, ordinances, laws, and commandments that the LORD gave the descendants of Jacob, whom He named Israel.
</p>

<p>
<a id="17-35"></a> <b>35</b> For the LORD had made a covenant with the Israelites and commanded them, “Do not worship other gods or bow down to them; do not serve them or sacrifice to them. 
<a id="17-36"></a> <b>36</b> Instead, worship the LORD, who brought you out of the land of Egypt with great power and an outstretched arm. You are to bow down to Him and offer sacrifices to Him. 
<a id="17-37"></a> <b>37</b> And you must always be careful to observe the statutes, ordinances, laws, and commandments He wrote for you. Do not worship other gods. 
<a id="17-38"></a> <b>38</b> Do not forget the covenant I have made with you. Do not worship other gods, 
<a id="17-39"></a> <b>39</b> but worship the LORD your God, and He will deliver you from the hands of all your enemies.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="17-40"></a> <b>40</b> But they would not listen, and they persisted in their former customs. 
<a id="17-41"></a> <b>41</b> So these nations worshiped the LORD but also served their idols, and to this day their children and grandchildren continue to do as their fathers did.

<a id="18-18"></a> <b>18</b> Then they called for the king; and Eliakim son of Hilkiah the palace administrator, Shebnah the scribe, and Joah son of Asaph the recorder, went out to them.
</p>

<p>
<a id="18-19"></a> <b>19</b> The Rabshakeh said to them, “Tell Hezekiah that this is what the great king, the king of Assyria, says: What is the basis of this confidence of yours? 
<a id="18-20"></a> <b>20</b> You claim to have a strategy and strength for war, but these are empty words. In whom are you now trusting, that you have rebelled against me?

<a id="18-25"></a> <b>25</b> So now, was it apart from the LORD that I have come up against this place to destroy it? The LORD Himself said to me, ‘Go up against this land and destroy it.&rsquo; ”

<p>
<a id="18-26"></a> <b>26</b> Then Eliakim son of Hilkiah, along with Shebnah and Joah, said to the Rabshakeh, “Please speak to your servants in Aramaic, since we understand it. Do not speak with us in Hebrew in the hearing of the people on the wall.”

<p>
<a id="18-27"></a> <b>27</b> But the Rabshakeh replied, “Has my master sent me to speak these words only to you and your master, and not to the men sitting on the wall, who are destined with you to eat their own dung and drink their own urine?”

<a id="18-28"></a> <b>28</b> Then the Rabshakeh stood and called out loudly in Hebrew: “Hear the word of the great king, the king of Assyria!

<p>
<a id="18-36"></a> <b>36</b> But the people remained silent and did not answer a word, for Hezekiah had commanded, “Do not answer him.”

<a id="25-1"></a> So in the ninth year of Zedekiah&rsquo;s reign, on the tenth day of the tenth month, Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon marched against Jerusalem with his entire army. They encamped outside the city and built a siege wall all around it. 
<a id="25-2"></a> <b>2</b> And the city was kept under siege until King Zedekiah&rsquo;s eleventh year.
</p>

<p>
<a id="25-3"></a> <b>3</b> By the ninth day of the fourth month, the famine in the city was so severe that the people of the land had no food. 
<a id="25-4"></a> <b>4</b> Then the city was breached; and though the Chaldeans had surrounded the city, all the men of war fled by night by way of the gate between the two walls near the king&rsquo;s garden.
</p>

<p>
They headed toward the Arabah, 
<a id="25-5"></a> <b>5</b> but the army of the Chaldeans pursued the king and overtook him in the plains of Jericho, and all his army was separated from him. 
<a id="25-6"></a> <b>6</b> The Chaldeans seized the king and brought him up to the king of Babylon at Riblah, where they pronounced judgment on him. 
<a id="25-7"></a> <b>7</b> And they slaughtered the sons of Zedekiah before his eyes. Then they put out his eyes, bound him with bronze shackles, and took him to Babylon.

<a id="25-8"></a> <b>8</b> On the seventh day of the fifth month, in the nineteenth year of Nebuchadnezzar&rsquo;s reign over Babylon, Nebuzaradan captain of the guard, a servant of the king of Babylon, entered Jerusalem. 
<a id="25-9"></a> <b>9</b> He burned down the house of the LORD, the royal palace, and all the houses of Jerusalem&#x2014;every significant building. 
<a id="25-10"></a> <b>10</b> And the whole army of the Chaldeans under the captain of the guard broke down the walls around Jerusalem.
</p>

<p>
<a id="25-11"></a> <b>11</b> Then Nebuzaradan captain of the guard carried into exile the people who remained in the city, along with the deserters who had defected to the king of Babylon and the rest of the population. 
<a id="25-12"></a> <b>12</b> But the captain of the guard left behind some of the poorest of the land to tend the vineyards and fields.
</p>

<p>
<a id="25-13"></a> <b>13</b> Moreover, the Chaldeans broke up the bronze pillars and stands and the bronze Sea in the house of the LORD, and they carried the bronze to Babylon. 
<a id="25-14"></a> <b>14</b> They also took away the pots, shovels, wick trimmers, dishes, and all the articles of bronze used in the temple service. 
<a id="25-15"></a> <b>15</b> The captain of the guard also took away the censers and sprinkling bowls&#x2014;anything made of pure gold or fine silver.
</p>

<p>
<a id="25-16"></a> <b>16</b> As for the two pillars, the Sea, and the movable stands that Solomon had made for the house of the LORD, the weight of the bronze from all these articles was beyond measure. 
<a id="25-17"></a> <b>17</b> Each pillar was eighteen cubits tall. The bronze capital atop one pillar was three cubits high, with a network of bronze pomegranates all around. The second pillar, with its network, was similar.

<p>
<a id="25-20"></a> <b>20</b> Nebuzaradan captain of the guard took them and brought them to the king of Babylon at Riblah.

<a id="1-1"></a> Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God, according to the promise of life in Christ Jesus,
</p>

<p>
<a id="1-2"></a> <b>2</b> To Timothy, my beloved child:
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org781a60c" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org781a60c">Grace, mercy, and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord.</h3>

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org36d8a11">
<p>
<a id="1-3"></a> <b>3</b> I thank God, whom I serve with a clear conscience as did my forefathers, as I constantly remember you night and day in my prayers. 
<a id="1-4"></a> <b>4</b> Recalling your tears, I long to see you so that I may be filled with joy.
</p>

<p>
<a id="1-5"></a> <b>5</b> I am reminded of your sincere faith, which first dwelt in your grandmother Lois and your mother Eunice, and I am convinced is in you as well.
</p>

<p>
<a id="1-6"></a> <b>6</b> For this reason I remind you to fan into flame the gift of God, which is in you through the laying on of my hands. 
<a id="1-7"></a> <b>7</b> For God has not given us a spirit of fear, but of power, love, and self-control.
</p>

<p>
<a id="1-8"></a> <b>8</b> So do not be ashamed of the testimony of our Lord, or of me, His prisoner. Instead, join me in suffering for the gospel by the power of God. 
<a id="1-9"></a> <b>9</b> He has saved us and called us to a holy calling, not because of our works, but by His own purpose and by the grace He granted us in Christ Jesus before time began. 
<a id="1-10"></a> <b>10</b> And now He has revealed this grace through the appearing of our Savior, Christ Jesus, who has abolished death and illuminated the way to life and immortality through the gospel, 
<a id="1-11"></a> <b>11</b> to which I was appointed as a preacher, an apostle, and a teacher.
</p>

<p>
<a id="1-12"></a> <b>12</b> For this reason, even though I suffer as I do, I am not ashamed; for I know whom I have believed, and I am convinced that He is able to guard what I have entrusted to Him for that day.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgd6163d9">
<p>
<a id="1-13"></a> <b>13</b> Hold on to the pattern of sound teaching you have heard from me, with the faith and love that are in Christ Jesus. 
<a id="1-14"></a> <b>14</b> Guard the treasure entrusted to you, with the help of the Holy Spirit who dwells in us.
</p>

<p>
<a id="1-15"></a> <b>15</b> You know that everyone in the Province of Asia has deserted me, including Phygelus and Hermogenes.
</p>

<p>
<a id="1-16"></a> <b>16</b> May the Lord grant mercy to the household of Onesiphorus, because he has often refreshed me and was unashamed of my chains. 
<a id="1-17"></a> <b>17</b> Indeed, when he arrived in Rome, he searched diligently until he found me.
</p>

<p>
<a id="1-18"></a> <b>18</b> May the Lord grant Onesiphorus His mercy on that day. You know very well how much he ministered to me in Ephesus.

<p>
<a id="2-1"></a> You therefore, my child, be strong in the grace that is in Christ Jesus. 
<a id="2-2"></a> <b>2</b> And the things that you have heard me say among many witnesses, entrust these to faithful men who will be qualified to teach others as well.
</p>

<p>
<a id="2-3"></a> <b>3</b> Join me in suffering, like a good soldier of Christ Jesus. 
<a id="2-4"></a> <b>4</b> A soldier refrains from entangling himself in civilian affairs, in order to please the one who enlisted him. 
<a id="2-5"></a> <b>5</b> Likewise, a competitor does not receive the crown unless he competes according to the rules. 
<a id="2-6"></a> <b>6</b> The hardworking farmer should be the first to partake of the crops. 
<a id="2-7"></a> <b>7</b> Consider what I am saying, for the Lord will give you insight into all things.
</p>

<p>
<a id="2-8"></a> <b>8</b> Remember Jesus Christ, raised from the dead, descended from David, as proclaimed by my gospel, 
<a id="2-9"></a> <b>9</b> for which I suffer to the extent of being chained like a criminal. But the word of God cannot be chained! 
<a id="2-10"></a> <b>10</b> For this reason I endure all things for the sake of the elect, so that they too may obtain the salvation that is in Christ Jesus, with eternal glory.
</p>

<p>
<a id="2-11"></a> <b>11</b> This is a trustworthy saying:

we will also reign with Him;

if we deny Him,

He will also deny us;

He remains faithful,

for He cannot deny Himself.

<h3 id="org5597134">The Lord&rsquo;s Approved Workman</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org5597134">
<p>
<a id="2-14"></a> <b>14</b> Remind the believers of these things, charging them before God to avoid quarreling over words, which succeeds only in leading the listeners to ruin.
</p>

<p>
<a id="2-15"></a> <b>15</b> Make every effort to present yourself approved to God, an unashamed workman who accurately handles the word of truth.
</p>

<p>
<a id="2-16"></a> <b>16</b> But avoid irreverent, empty chatter, which will only lead to more ungodliness, 
<a id="2-17"></a> <b>17</b> and the talk of such men will spread like gangrene. Among them are Hymenaeus and Philetus, 
<a id="2-18"></a> <b>18</b> who have deviated from the truth. They say that the resurrection has already occurred, and they undermine the faith of some.
</p>

<p>
<a id="2-19"></a> <b>19</b> Nevertheless, God&rsquo;s firm foundation stands, bearing this seal: “The Lord knows those who are His,” and, “Everyone who calls on the name of the Lord must turn away from iniquity.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="2-20"></a> <b>20</b> A large house contains not only vessels of gold and silver, but also of wood and clay. Some indeed are for honorable use, but others are for common use. 
<a id="2-21"></a> <b>21</b> So if anyone cleanses himself of what is unfit, he will be a vessel for honor: sanctified, useful to the Master, and prepared for every good work.
</p>

<p>
<a id="2-22"></a> <b>22</b> Flee from youthful passions and pursue righteousness, faith, love, and peace, together with those who call on the Lord out of a pure heart.
</p>

<p>
<a id="2-23"></a> <b>23</b> But reject foolish and ignorant speculation, for you know that it breeds quarreling. 
<a id="2-24"></a> <b>24</b> And a servant of the Lord must not be quarrelsome, but must be kind to everyone, able to teach, and forbearing. 
<a id="2-25"></a> <b>25</b> He must gently reprove those who oppose him, in the hope that God may grant them repentance leading to a knowledge of the truth. 
<a id="2-26"></a> <b>26</b> Then they will come to their senses and escape the snare of the devil, who has taken them captive to his will.

<a id="3-1"></a> But understand this: In the last days terrible times will come.

<a id="3-5"></a> <b>5</b> having a form of godliness but denying its power. Turn away from such as these!
</p>

<p>
<a id="3-6"></a> <b>6</b> They are the kind who worm their way into households and captivate vulnerable women who are weighed down with sins and led astray by various passions, 
<a id="3-7"></a> <b>7</b> who are always learning but never able to come to a knowledge of the truth.
</p>

<p>
<a id="3-8"></a> <b>8</b> Just as Jannes and Jambres opposed Moses, so also these men oppose the truth. They are depraved in mind and disqualified from the faith.

<a id="3-12"></a> <b>12</b> Indeed, all who desire to live godly lives in Christ Jesus will be persecuted, 
<a id="3-13"></a> <b>13</b> while evil men and imposters go from bad to worse, deceiving and being deceived.

<p>
<a id="3-14"></a> <b>14</b> But as for you, continue in the things you have learned and firmly believed, since you know from whom you have learned them.

<a id="1-1"></a> In my first book, O Theophilus, I wrote about all that Jesus began to do and to teach, 
<a id="1-2"></a> <b>2</b> until the day He was taken up to heaven, after giving instructions through the Holy Spirit to the apostles He had chosen. 
<a id="1-3"></a> <b>3</b> After His suffering, He presented Himself to them with many convincing proofs that He was alive. He appeared to them over a span of forty days and spoke about the kingdom of God.
</p>

<p>
<a id="1-4"></a> <b>4</b> And while they were gathered together, He commanded them: “Do not leave Jerusalem, but wait for the gift the Father promised, which you have heard Me discuss. 
<a id="1-5"></a> <b>5</b> For John baptized with water, but in a few days you will be baptized with the Holy Spirit.”

<h3 id="org7738979">The Ascension (Mark 16:19&#x2013;20; Luke 24:50&#x2013;53)</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org7738979">
<p>
<a id="1-6"></a> <b>6</b> So when they came together, they asked Him, “Lord, will You at this time restore the kingdom to Israel?”
</p>

<p>
<a id="1-7"></a> <b>7</b> Jesus replied, “It is not for you to know times or seasons that the Father has fixed by His own authority. 
<a id="1-8"></a> <b>8</b> But you will receive power when the Holy Spirit comes upon you, and you will be My witnesses in Jerusalem, and in all Judea and Samaria, and to the ends of the earth.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="1-9"></a> <b>9</b> After He had said this, they watched as He was taken up, and a cloud hid Him from their sight. 
<a id="1-10"></a> <b>10</b> They were looking intently into the sky as He was going, when suddenly two men dressed in white stood beside them.
<a id="1-11"></a> <b>11</b> “Men of Galilee,” they said, “why do you stand here looking into the sky? This same Jesus, who has been taken from you into heaven, will come back in the same way you have seen Him go into heaven.”

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orga764d85">
<p>
<a id="1-12"></a> <b>12</b> Then they returned to Jerusalem from the Mount of Olives, which is near the city, a Sabbath day&rsquo;s journey away. 
<a id="1-13"></a> <b>13</b> When they arrived, they went to the upper room where they were staying: Peter and John, James and Andrew, Philip and Thomas, Bartholomew and Matthew, James son of Alphaeus, Simon the Zealot, and Judas son of James. 
<a id="1-14"></a> <b>14</b> With one accord they all continued in prayer, along with the women and Mary the mother of Jesus, and with His brothers.
</p>

<p>
<a id="1-15"></a> <b>15</b> In those days Peter stood up among the brothers (a gathering of about a hundred and twenty) and said,
<a id="1-16"></a> <b>16</b> “Brothers, the Scripture had to be fulfilled which the Holy Spirit foretold through the mouth of David concerning Judas, who became a guide for those who arrested Jesus. 
<a id="1-17"></a> <b>17</b> He was one of our number and shared in this ministry.”
</p>

<p>
18(Now with the reward for his wickedness Judas bought a field; there he fell headlong and burst open in the middle, and all his intestines spilled out. 
<a id="1-19"></a> <b>19</b> This became known to all who lived in Jerusalem, so they called that field in their own language Akeldama, that is, Field of Blood.)
</p>

<p>
<a id="1-20"></a> <b>20</b> “For it is written in the book of Psalms:
</p>

<p>
‘May his place be deserted;
</p>

<p>
let there be no one to dwell in it,&rsquo;
</p>

<p>
and,
</p>

<p>
‘May another take his position.&rsquo;
</p>

<p>
<a id="1-21"></a> <b>21</b> Therefore it is necessary to choose one of the men who have accompanied us the whole time the Lord Jesus went in and out among us, 
<a id="1-22"></a> <b>22</b> beginning from John&rsquo;s baptism until the day Jesus was taken up from us. For one of these must become a witness with us of His resurrection.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="1-23"></a> <b>23</b> So they proposed two men: Joseph called Barsabbas (also known as Justus) and Matthias. 
<a id="1-24"></a> <b>24</b> And they prayed, “Lord, You know everyone&rsquo;s heart. Show us which of these two You have chosen 
<a id="1-25"></a> <b>25</b> to take up this ministry and apostleship, which Judas abandoned to go to his rightful place.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="1-26"></a> <b>26</b> Then they cast lots, and the lot fell to Matthias; so he was added to the eleven apostles.

<p>
<a id="2-1"></a> When the day of Pentecost came, they were all together in one place. 
<a id="2-2"></a> <b>2</b> Suddenly a sound like a mighty rushing wind came from heaven and filled the whole house where they were sitting. 
<a id="2-3"></a> <b>3</b> They saw tongues like flames of fire that separated and came to rest on each of them. 
<a id="2-4"></a> <b>4</b> And they were all filled with the Holy Spirit and began to speak in other tongues as the Spirit enabled them.
</p>

<p>
<a id="2-5"></a> <b>5</b> Now there were dwelling in Jerusalem God-fearing Jews from every nation under heaven. 
<a id="2-6"></a> <b>6</b> And when this sound rang out, a crowd came together in bewilderment, because each one heard them speaking his own language.
</p>

<p>
<a id="2-7"></a> <b>7</b> Astounded and amazed, they asked, “Are not all these men who are speaking Galileans? 
<a id="2-8"></a> <b>8</b> How is it then that each of us hears them in his own native language? 
<a id="2-9"></a> <b>9</b> Parthians, Medes, and Elamites; residents of Mesopotamia, Judea and Cappadocia, Pontus and Asia, 
<a id="2-10"></a> <b>10</b> Phrygia and Pamphylia, Egypt and the parts of Libya near Cyrene; visitors from Rome, 
<a id="2-11"></a> <b>11</b> both Jews and converts to Judaism; Cretans and Arabs&#x2014;we hear them declaring the wonders of God in our own tongues!”
</p>

<p>
<a id="2-12"></a> <b>12</b> Astounded and perplexed, they asked one another, “What does this mean?”

<p>
<a id="2-13"></a> <b>13</b> But others mocked them and said, “They are drunk on new wine!”

<a id="2-14"></a> <b>14</b> Then Peter stood up with the Eleven, lifted up his voice, and addressed the crowd: “Men of Judea and all who dwell in Jerusalem, let this be known to you, and listen carefully to my words. 
<a id="2-15"></a> <b>15</b> These men are not drunk, as you suppose. It is only the third hour of the day! 
<a id="2-16"></a> <b>16</b> No, this is what was spoken by the prophet Joel:
</p>

<p>
17‘In the last days, God says,

<p>
I will pour out My Spirit on all people.
</p>

<p>
Your sons and daughters will prophesy,
</p>

<p>
your young men will see visions,

<p>
your old men will dream dreams.
</p>

<p>
<a id="2-18"></a> <b>18</b> Even on My menservants and maidservants
</p>

<p>
I will pour out My Spirit in those days,
</p>

<p>
and they will prophesy.
</p>

<p>
<a id="2-19"></a> <b>19</b> I will show wonders in the heavens above
</p>

<p>
and signs on the earth below,
</p>

<p>
blood and fire and billows of smoke.
</p>

<p>
<a id="2-20"></a> <b>20</b> The sun will be turned to darkness,
</p>

<p>
and the moon to blood,
</p>

<p>
before the coming of the great and glorious Day of the Lord.
</p>

<p>
<a id="2-21"></a> <b>21</b> And everyone who calls on the name of the Lord
</p>

<p>
will be saved.&rsquo;
</p>

<p>
<a id="2-22"></a> <b>22</b> Men of Israel, listen to this message: Jesus of Nazareth was a man certified by God to you by miracles, wonders, and signs, which God did among you through Him, as you yourselves know. 
<a id="2-23"></a> <b>23</b> He was delivered up by God&rsquo;s set plan and foreknowledge, and you, by the hands of the lawless, put Him to death by nailing Him to the cross. 
<a id="2-24"></a> <b>24</b> But God raised Him from the dead, releasing Him from the agony of death, because it was impossible for Him to be held in its clutches.
</p>

<p>
<a id="2-25"></a> <b>25</b> David says about Him:
</p>

<p>
‘I saw the Lord always before me;
</p>

<p>
because He is at my right hand, I will not be shaken.
</p>

<p>
<a id="2-26"></a> <b>26</b> Therefore my heart is glad and my tongue rejoices;
</p>

<p>
my body also will dwell in hope,
</p>

<p>
<a id="2-27"></a> <b>27</b> because You will not abandon my soul to Hades,
</p>

<p>
nor will You let Your Holy One see decay.
</p>

<p>
<a id="2-28"></a> <b>28</b> You have made known to me the paths of life;
</p>

<p>
You will fill me with joy in Your presence.&rsquo;
</p>

<p>
<a id="2-29"></a> <b>29</b> Brothers, I can tell you with confidence that the patriarch David died and was buried, and his tomb is with us to this day. 
<a id="2-30"></a> <b>30</b> But he was a prophet and knew that God had promised him on oath that He would place one of his descendants on his throne. 
<a id="2-31"></a> <b>31</b> Foreseeing this, David spoke about the resurrection of the Christ, that He was not abandoned to Hades, nor did His body see decay. 
<a id="2-32"></a> <b>32</b> God has raised this Jesus to life, to which we are all witnesses.
</p>

<p>
<a id="2-33"></a> <b>33</b> Exalted, then, to the right hand of God, He has received from the Father the promised Holy Spirit and has poured out what you now see and hear. 
<a id="2-34"></a> <b>34</b> For David did not ascend into heaven, but he himself says:
</p>

<p>
‘The Lord said to my Lord,
</p>

<p>
“Sit at My right hand
</p>

<p>
<a id="2-35"></a> <b>35</b> until I make Your enemies
</p>

<p>
a footstool for Your feet.” &rsquo;
</p>

<p>
<a id="2-36"></a> <b>36</b> Therefore let all Israel know with certainty that God has made this Jesus, whom you crucified, both Lord and Christ!”

<a id="2-37"></a> <b>37</b> When the people heard this, they were cut to the heart and asked Peter and the other apostles, “Brothers, what shall we do?”
</p>

<p>
<a id="2-38"></a> <b>38</b> Peter replied, “Repent and be baptized, every one of you, in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins, and you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit. 
<a id="2-39"></a> <b>39</b> This promise belongs to you and your children and to all who are far off&#x2014;to all whom the Lord our God will call to Himself.”

<p>
<a id="3-1"></a> One afternoon Peter and John were going up to the temple at the hour of prayer, the ninth hour. 
<a id="3-2"></a> <b>2</b> And a man who was lame from birth was being carried to the temple gate called Beautiful, where he was put every day to beg from those entering the temple courts. 
<a id="3-3"></a> <b>3</b> When he saw Peter and John about to enter, he asked them for money.
</p>

<p>
<a id="3-4"></a> <b>4</b> Peter looked directly at him, as did John. “Look at us!” said Peter. 
<a id="3-5"></a> <b>5</b> So the man gave them his attention, expecting to receive something from them. 
<a id="3-6"></a> <b>6</b> But Peter said, “Silver or gold I do not have, but what I have I give you: In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, get up and walk!”
</p>

<p>
<a id="3-7"></a> <b>7</b> Taking him by the right hand, Peter helped him up, and at once the man&rsquo;s feet and ankles were made strong. 
<a id="3-8"></a> <b>8</b> He sprang to his feet and began to walk. Then he went with them into the temple courts, walking and leaping and praising God.
</p>

<p>
<a id="3-9"></a> <b>9</b> When all the people saw him walking and praising God, 
<a id="3-10"></a> <b>10</b> they recognized him as the man who used to sit begging at the Beautiful Gate of the temple, and they were filled with wonder and amazement at what had happened to him.

<p>
<a id="3-11"></a> <b>11</b> While the man clung to Peter and John, all the people were astonished and ran to them in the walkway called Solomon&rsquo;s Colonnade. 
<a id="3-12"></a> <b>12</b> And when Peter saw this, he addressed the people: “Men of Israel, why are you surprised by this? Why do you stare at us as if by our own power or godliness we had made this man walk?
</p>

<p>
<a id="3-13"></a> <b>13</b> The God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, the God of our fathers, has glorified His servant Jesus. You handed Him over and rejected Him before Pilate, even though he had decided to release Him. 
<a id="3-14"></a> <b>14</b> You rejected the Holy and Righteous One and asked that a murderer be released to you. 
<a id="3-15"></a> <b>15</b> You killed the Author of life, but God raised Him from the dead, and we are witnesses of the fact.
</p>

<p>
<a id="3-16"></a> <b>16</b> By faith in the name of Jesus, this man whom you see and know has been made strong. It is Jesus&rsquo; name and the faith that comes through Him that has given him this complete healing in your presence.
</p>

<p>
<a id="3-17"></a> <b>17</b> And now, brothers, I know that you acted in ignorance, as did your leaders. 
<a id="3-18"></a> <b>18</b> But in this way God has fulfilled what He foretold through all the prophets, saying that His Christ would suffer. 
<a id="3-19"></a> <b>19</b> Repent, then, and turn back, so that your sins may be wiped away, 
<a id="3-20"></a> <b>20</b> that times of refreshing may come from the presence of the Lord, and that He may send Jesus, the Christ, who has been appointed for you.
</p>

<p>
<a id="3-21"></a> <b>21</b> Heaven must take Him in until the time comes for the restoration of all things, which God announced long ago through His holy prophets. 
<a id="3-22"></a> <b>22</b> For Moses said, ‘The Lord your God will raise up for you a prophet like me from among your brothers. You must listen to Him in everything He tells you. 
<a id="3-23"></a> <b>23</b> Everyone who does not listen to Him will be completely cut off from among his people.&rsquo;
</p>

<p>
<a id="3-24"></a> <b>24</b> Indeed, all the prophets from Samuel on, as many as have spoken, have proclaimed these days. 
<a id="3-25"></a> <b>25</b> And you are sons of the prophets and of the covenant God made with your fathers when He said to Abraham, ‘Through your offspring all the families of the earth will be blessed.&rsquo; 
<a id="3-26"></a> <b>26</b> When God raised up His Servant, He sent Him first to you to bless you by turning each of you from your wicked ways.”

<a id="6-1"></a> In those days when the disciples were increasing in number, the Grecian Jews among them began to grumble against the Hebraic Jews because their widows were being overlooked in the daily distribution of food.

<p>
<a id="6-2"></a> <b>2</b> So the Twelve summoned all the disciples and said, “It is unacceptable for us to neglect the word of God in order to wait on tables.

</p>

<p>
<a id="6-5"></a> <b>5</b> This proposal pleased the whole group. They chose Stephen, a man full of faith and of the Holy Spirit, as well as Philip, Prochorus, Nicanor, Timon, Parmenas, and Nicolas from Antioch, a convert to Judaism. 
<a id="6-6"></a> <b>6</b> They presented these seven to the apostles, who prayed and laid their hands on them.

<a id="7-56"></a> <b>56</b> “Look,” he said, “I see heaven open and the Son of Man standing at the right hand of God.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="7-57"></a> <b>57</b> At this they covered their ears, cried out in a loud voice, and rushed together at him. 
<a id="7-58"></a> <b>58</b> They dragged him out of the city and began to stone him. Meanwhile the witnesses laid their garments at the feet of a young man named Saul.

<a id="7-59"></a> <b>59</b> While they were stoning him, Stephen appealed, “Lord Jesus, receive my spirit.”

<a id="8-9"></a> <b>9</b> Prior to that time, a man named Simon had practiced sorcery in the city and astounded the people of Samaria. He claimed to be someone great, 
<a id="8-10"></a> <b>10</b> and all the people, from the least to the greatest, heeded his words and said, “This man is the divine power called the Great Power.” 
<a id="8-11"></a> <b>11</b> They paid close attention to him because he had astounded them for a long time with his sorcery.
</p>

<p>
<a id="8-12"></a> <b>12</b> But when they believed Philip as he preached the gospel of the kingdom of God and the name of Jesus Christ, they were baptized, both men and women. 
<a id="8-13"></a> <b>13</b> Even Simon himself believed and was baptized. He followed Philip closely and was astounded by the great signs and miracles he observed.
</p>

<p>
<a id="8-14"></a> <b>14</b> When the apostles in Jerusalem heard that Samaria had received the word of God, they sent Peter and John to them. 
<a id="8-15"></a> <b>15</b> On their arrival, they prayed for them to receive the Holy Spirit. 
<a id="8-16"></a> <b>16</b> For the Holy Spirit had not yet fallen upon any of them; they had simply been baptized into the name of the Lord Jesus. 
<a id="8-17"></a> <b>17</b> Then Peter and John laid their hands on them, and they received the Holy Spirit.
</p>

<p>
<a id="8-18"></a> <b>18</b> When Simon saw that the Spirit was given through the laying on of the apostles&rsquo; hands, he offered them money.
<a id="8-19"></a> <b>19</b> “Give me this power as well,” he said, “so that everyone on whom I lay my hands may receive the Holy Spirit.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="8-20"></a> <b>20</b> But Peter replied, “May your silver perish with you, because you thought you could buy the gift of God with money! 
<a id="8-21"></a> <b>21</b> You have no part or share in our ministry, because your heart is not right before God. 
<a id="8-22"></a> <b>22</b> Repent, therefore, of your wickedness, and pray to the Lord. Perhaps He will forgive you for the intent of your heart. 
<a id="8-23"></a> <b>23</b> For I see that you are poisoned by bitterness and captive to iniquity.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="8-24"></a> <b>24</b> Then Simon answered, “Pray to the Lord for me, so that nothing you have said may happen to me.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="8-25"></a> <b>25</b> And after Peter and John had testified and spoken the word of the Lord, they returned to Jerusalem, preaching the gospel in many of the Samaritan villages.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org5be1cf5">

<a id="8-26"></a> <b>26</b> Now an angel of the Lord said to Philip, “Get up and go south to the desert road that goes down from Jerusalem to Gaza.” 
<a id="8-27"></a> <b>27</b> So he started out, and on his way he met an Ethiopian eunuch, a court official in charge of the entire treasury of Candace, queen of the Ethiopians. He had gone to Jerusalem to worship, 
<a id="8-28"></a> <b>28</b> and on his return was sitting in his chariot reading Isaiah the prophet.
</p>

<p>
<a id="8-29"></a> <b>29</b> The Spirit said to Philip, “Go over to that chariot and stay by it.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="8-30"></a> <b>30</b> So Philip ran up and heard the man reading Isaiah the prophet. “Do you understand what you are reading?” Philip asked.
</p>

<p>
<a id="8-31"></a> <b>31</b> “How can I,” he said, “unless someone guides me?” And he invited Philip to come up and sit with him.
</p>

<p>
<a id="8-32"></a> <b>32</b> The eunuch was reading this passage of Scripture:
</p>

<p>
“He was led like a sheep to the slaughter,

and as a lamb before the shearer is silent,

<p>
so He did not open His mouth.
</p>

<p>
<a id="8-33"></a> <b>33</b> In His humiliation He was deprived of justice.

<p>
Who can recount His descendants?
</p>

<p>
For His life was removed from the earth.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="8-34"></a> <b>34</b> “Tell me,” said the eunuch, “who is the prophet talking about, himself or someone else?”
</p>

<p>
<a id="8-35"></a> <b>35</b> Then Philip began with this very Scripture and told him the good news about Jesus.
</p>

<p>
<a id="8-36"></a> <b>36</b> As they traveled along the road and came to some water, the eunuch said, “Look, here is water! What is there to prevent me from being baptized?” 
<a id="8-38"></a> <b>38</b> And he gave orders to stop the chariot. Then both Philip and the eunuch went down into the water, and Philip baptized him.
</p>

<p>
<a id="8-39"></a> <b>39</b> When they came up out of the water, the Spirit of the Lord carried Philip away, and the eunuch saw him no more, but went on his way rejoicing.

<p>

Then Peter said,

</p>

<p>
<a id="11-1"></a> The apostles and brothers throughout Judea soon heard that the Gentiles also had received the word of God. 
<a id="11-2"></a> <b>2</b> So when Peter went up to Jerusalem, the circumcised believers took issue with him 
<a id="11-3"></a> <b>3</b> and said, “You visited uncircumcised men and ate with them.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="11-4"></a> <b>4</b> But Peter began and explained to them the whole sequence of events:
<a id="11-5"></a> <b>5</b> “I was in the city of Joppa praying, and in a trance I saw a vision of something like a large sheet being let down from heaven by its four corners, and it came right down to me. 
<a id="11-6"></a> <b>6</b> I looked at it closely and saw four-footed animals of the earth, wild beasts, reptiles, and birds of the air. 
<a id="11-7"></a> <b>7</b> Then I heard a voice saying to me, ‘Get up, Peter, kill and eat.&rsquo;
</p>

<p>
8‘No, Lord,&rsquo; I said, ‘for nothing impure or unclean has ever entered my mouth.&rsquo;
</p>

<p>
<a id="11-9"></a> <b>9</b> But the voice spoke from heaven a second time, ‘Do not call anything impure that God has made clean.&rsquo;
</p>

<p>
<a id="11-10"></a> <b>10</b> This happened three times, and everything was drawn back up into heaven.
</p>

<p>
<a id="11-11"></a> <b>11</b> Just then three men sent to me from Caesarea stopped at the house where I was staying. 
<a id="11-12"></a> <b>12</b> The Spirit told me to accompany them without hesitation. These six brothers also went with me, and we entered the man&rsquo;s home. 
<a id="11-13"></a> <b>13</b> He told us how he had seen an angel standing in his house and saying, ‘Send to Joppa for Simon who is called Peter. 
<a id="11-14"></a> <b>14</b> He will convey to you a message by which you and all your household will be saved.&rsquo;
</p>

<p>
<a id="11-15"></a> <b>15</b> As I began to speak, the Holy Spirit fell upon them, just as He had fallen upon us at the beginning. 
<a id="11-16"></a> <b>16</b> Then I remembered the word of the Lord, as He used to say, ‘John baptized with water, but you will be baptized with the Holy Spirit.&rsquo; 
<a id="11-17"></a> <b>17</b> So if God gave them the same gift He gave us who believed in the Lord Jesus Christ, who was I to hinder the work of God?”
</p>

<p>
<a id="11-18"></a> <b>18</b> When they heard this, their objections were put to rest, and they glorified God, saying, “So then, God has granted even the Gentiles repentance unto life.”

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgb1a01a5">
<p>
<a id="11-19"></a> <b>19</b> Meanwhile those scattered by the persecution that began with Stephen traveled as far as Phoenicia, Cyprus, and Antioch, speaking the message only to Jews. 
<a id="11-20"></a> <b>20</b> But some of them, men from Cyprus and Cyrene, went to Antioch and began speaking to the Greeks as well, proclaiming the good news about the Lord Jesus. 
<a id="11-21"></a> <b>21</b> The hand of the Lord was with them, and a great number of people believed and turned to the Lord.
</p>

<p>
<a id="11-22"></a> <b>22</b> When news of this reached the ears of the church in Jerusalem, they sent Barnabas to Antioch. 
<a id="11-23"></a> <b>23</b> When he arrived and saw the grace of God, he rejoiced and encouraged them all to abide in the Lord with all their hearts. 
<a id="11-24"></a> <b>24</b> Barnabas was a good man, full of the Holy Spirit and faith, and a great number of people were brought to the Lord.
</p>

<p>
<a id="11-25"></a> <b>25</b> Then Barnabas went to Tarsus to look for Saul, 
<a id="11-26"></a> <b>26</b> and when he found him, he brought him back to Antioch. So for a full year they met together with the church and taught large numbers of people. The disciples were first called Christians at Antioch.
</p>

<p>
<a id="11-27"></a> <b>27</b> In those days some prophets came down from Jerusalem to Antioch. 
<a id="11-28"></a> <b>28</b> One of them named Agabus stood up and predicted through the Spirit that a great famine would sweep across the whole world. (This happened under Claudius.) 
<a id="11-29"></a> <b>29</b> So the disciples, each according to his ability, decided to send relief to the brothers living in Judea.

<a id="12-1"></a> About that time, King Herod reached out to harm some who belonged to the church. 
<a id="12-2"></a> <b>2</b> He had James, the brother of John, put to death with the sword.
</p>

<p>
<a id="12-3"></a> <b>3</b> And seeing that this pleased the Jews, Herod proceeded to seize Peter during the Feast of Unleavened Bread. 
<a id="12-4"></a> <b>4</b> He arrested him and put him in prison, handing him over to be guarded by four squads of four soldiers each. Herod intended to bring him out to the people after the Passover.

<h3 id="orgc3cdcac">The Rescue of Peter</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgc3cdcac">

<a id="12-5"></a> <b>5</b> So Peter was kept in prison, but the church was fervently praying to God for him.
</p>

<p>
<a id="12-6"></a> <b>6</b> On the night before Herod was to bring him to trial, Peter was sleeping between two soldiers, bound with two chains, with sentries standing guard at the entrance to the prison. 
<a id="12-7"></a> <b>7</b> Suddenly an angel of the Lord appeared and a light shone in the cell. He tapped Peter on the side and woke him up, saying, “Get up quickly.” And the chains fell off his wrists.
<a id="12-8"></a> <b>8</b> “Get dressed and put on your sandals,” said the angel. Peter did so, and the angel told him, “Wrap your cloak around you and follow me.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="12-9"></a> <b>9</b> So Peter followed him out, but he was unaware that what the angel was doing was real. He thought he was only seeing a vision. 
<a id="12-10"></a> <b>10</b> They passed the first and second guards and came to the iron gate leading to the city, which opened for them by itself. When they had gone outside and walked the length of one block, the angel suddenly left him.
</p>

<p>
<a id="12-11"></a> <b>11</b> Then Peter came to himself and said, “Now I know for sure that the Lord has sent His angel and rescued me from Herod&rsquo;s grasp and from everything the Jewish people were anticipating.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="12-12"></a> <b>12</b> And when he had realized this, he went to the house of Mary the mother of John, also called Mark, where many people had gathered together and were praying. 
<a id="12-13"></a> <b>13</b> He knocked at the outer gate, and a servant girl named Rhoda came to answer it. 
<a id="12-14"></a> <b>14</b> When she recognized Peter&rsquo;s voice, she was so overjoyed that she forgot to open the gate, but ran inside and announced, “Peter is standing at the gate!”
</p>

<p>
<a id="12-15"></a> <b>15</b> “You are out of your mind,” they told her. But when she kept insisting it was so, they said, “It must be his angel.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="12-16"></a> <b>16</b> But Peter kept on knocking, and when they opened the door and saw him, they were astounded. 
<a id="12-17"></a> <b>17</b> Peter motioned with his hand for silence, and he described how the Lord had brought him out of the prison. “Send word to James and to the brothers,” he said, and he left for another place.
</p>

<p>
<a id="12-18"></a> <b>18</b> At daybreak there was no small commotion among the soldiers as to what had become of Peter. 
<a id="12-19"></a> <b>19</b> After Herod had searched for him unsuccessfully, he examined the guards and ordered that they be executed. Then he went down from Judea to Caesarea and spent some time there.

<a id="12-21"></a> <b>21</b> On the appointed day, Herod donned his royal robes, sat on his throne, and addressed the people.

</p>

<p>
<a id="12-23"></a> <b>23</b> Immediately, because Herod did not give glory to God, an angel of the Lord struck him down, and he was eaten by worms and died.

<a id="13-5"></a> <b>5</b> When they arrived at Salamis, they proclaimed the word of God in the Jewish synagogues. And John was with them as their helper.
</p>

<p>
<a id="13-6"></a> <b>6</b> They traveled through the whole island as far as Paphos, where they found a Jewish sorcerer and false prophet named Bar-Jesus, 
<a id="13-7"></a> <b>7</b> an attendant of the proconsul, Sergius Paulus. The proconsul, a man of intelligence, summoned Barnabas and Saul because he wanted to hear the word of God. 
<a id="13-8"></a> <b>8</b> But Elymas the sorcerer (for that is what his name means) opposed them and tried to turn the proconsul from the faith.
</p>

<p>
<a id="13-9"></a> <b>9</b> Then Saul, who was also called Paul, filled with the Holy Spirit, looked directly at Elymas 
<a id="13-10"></a> <b>10</b> and said, “O child of the devil and enemy of all righteousness, you are full of all kinds of deceit and trickery! Will you never stop perverting the straight ways of the Lord? 
<a id="13-11"></a> <b>11</b> Now look, the hand of the Lord is against you, and for a time you will be blind and unable to see the light of the sun.” Immediately mist and darkness came over him, and he groped about, seeking someone to lead him by the hand.

<a id="13-13"></a> <b>13</b> After setting sail from Paphos, Paul and his companions came to Perga in Pamphylia, where John left them to return to Jerusalem. 
<a id="13-14"></a> <b>14</b> And from Perga, they traveled inland to Pisidian Antioch, where they entered the synagogue on the Sabbath and sat down. 
<a id="13-15"></a> <b>15</b> After the reading from the Law and the Prophets, the synagogue leaders sent word to them: “Brothers, if you have a word of encouragement for the people, please speak.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="13-16"></a> <b>16</b> Paul stood up, motioned with his hand, and began to speak: “Men of Israel and you Gentiles who fear God, listen to me! 
<a id="13-17"></a> <b>17</b> The God of the people of Israel chose our fathers. He made them into a great people during their stay in Egypt, and with an uplifted arm He led them out of that land. 
<a id="13-18"></a> <b>18</b> He endured their conduct for about forty years in the wilderness. 
<a id="13-19"></a> <b>19</b> And having vanquished seven nations in Canaan, He gave their land to His people as an inheritance. 
<a id="13-20"></a> <b>20</b> All this took about 450 years.
</p>

<p>
After this, God gave them judges until the time of Samuel the prophet. 
<a id="13-21"></a> <b>21</b> Then the people asked for a king, and God gave them forty years under Saul son of Kish, from the tribe of Benjamin. 
<a id="13-22"></a> <b>22</b> After removing Saul, He raised up David as their king and testified about him: ‘I have found David son of Jesse a man after My own heart; he will carry out My will in its entirety.&rsquo;
</p>

<p>
<a id="13-23"></a> <b>23</b> From the descendants of this man, God has brought to Israel the Savior Jesus, as He promised. 
<a id="13-24"></a> <b>24</b> Before the arrival of Jesus, John preached a baptism of repentance to all the people of Israel. 
<a id="13-25"></a> <b>25</b> As John was completing his course, he said, ‘Who do you suppose I am? I am not that One. But He is coming after me whose sandals I am not worthy to untie.&rsquo;
</p>

<p>
<a id="13-26"></a> <b>26</b> Brothers, children of Abraham, and you Gentiles who fear God, it is to us that this message of salvation has been sent. 
<a id="13-27"></a> <b>27</b> The people of Jerusalem and their rulers did not recognize Jesus, yet in condemning Him they fulfilled the words of the prophets that are read every Sabbath. 
<a id="13-28"></a> <b>28</b> And though they found no ground for a death sentence, they asked Pilate to have Him executed.
</p>

<p>
<a id="13-29"></a> <b>29</b> When they had carried out all that was written about Him, they took Him down from the tree and laid Him in a tomb. 
<a id="13-30"></a> <b>30</b> But God raised Him from the dead, 
<a id="13-31"></a> <b>31</b> and for many days He was seen by those who had accompanied Him from Galilee to Jerusalem. They are now His witnesses to our people.
</p>

<p>
<a id="13-32"></a> <b>32</b> And now we proclaim to you the good news: What God promised our fathers 
<a id="13-33"></a> <b>33</b> He has fulfilled for us, their children, by raising up Jesus. As it is written in the second Psalm:
</p>

<p>
‘You are My Son;
</p>

<p>
today I have become Your Father.&rsquo;
</p>

<p>
<a id="13-34"></a> <b>34</b> In fact, God raised Him from the dead, never to see decay. As He has said:
</p>

<p>
‘I will give you the holy and sure blessings promised to David.&rsquo;
</p>

<p>
<a id="13-35"></a> <b>35</b> So also, He says in another Psalm:
</p>

<p>
‘You will not let Your Holy One see decay.&rsquo;
</p>

<p>
<a id="13-36"></a> <b>36</b> For when David had served God&rsquo;s purpose in his own generation, he fell asleep. His body was buried with his fathers and saw decay. 
<a id="13-37"></a> <b>37</b> But the One whom God raised from the dead did not see decay.
</p>

<p>
<a id="13-38"></a> <b>38</b> Therefore let it be known to you, brothers, that through Jesus the forgiveness of sins is proclaimed to you. 
<a id="13-39"></a> <b>39</b> Through Him everyone who believes is justified from everything you could not be justified from by the law of Moses. 
<a id="13-40"></a> <b>40</b> Watch out, then, that what was spoken by the prophets does not happen to you:
</p>

<p>
41‘Look, you scoffers,
</p>

<p>
wonder and perish!
</p>

<p>
For I am doing a work in your days
</p>

<p>
that you would never believe,

<p>
even if someone told you.&rsquo;”

<a id="13-44"></a> <b>44</b> On the following Sabbath, nearly the whole city gathered to hear the word of the Lord.

<a id="14-16"></a> <b>16</b> In past generations, He let all nations go their own way. 
<a id="14-17"></a> <b>17</b> Yet He has not left Himself without testimony to His goodness: He gives you rain from heaven and fruitful seasons, filling your hearts with food and gladness.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="14-18"></a> <b>18</b> Even with these words, Paul and Barnabas could hardly stop the crowds from sacrificing to them.

<p>
<a id="14-19"></a> <b>19</b> Then some Jews arrived from Antioch and Iconium and won over the crowds. They stoned Paul and dragged him outside the city, presuming he was dead.

<p>
<a id="18-1"></a> After this, Paul left Athens and went to Corinth. 
<a id="18-2"></a> <b>2</b> There he found a Jew named Aquila, a native of Pontus, who had recently come from Italy with his wife Priscilla because Claudius had ordered all the Jews to leave Rome. Paul went to visit them, 
<a id="18-3"></a> <b>3</b> and he stayed and worked with them because they were tentmakers by trade, just as he was.
</p>

<p>
<a id="18-4"></a> <b>4</b> Every Sabbath he reasoned in the synagogue, trying to persuade Jews and Greeks alike. 
<a id="18-5"></a> <b>5</b> And when Silas and Timothy came down from Macedonia, Paul devoted himself fully to the word, testifying to the Jews that Jesus is the Christ. 
<a id="18-6"></a> <b>6</b> But when they opposed and insulted him, he shook out his garments and told them, “Your blood be on your own heads! I am innocent of it. From now on I will go to the Gentiles.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="18-7"></a> <b>7</b> So Paul left the synagogue and went next door to the house of Titus Justus, a worshiper of God. 
<a id="18-8"></a> <b>8</b> Crispus, the synagogue leader, and his whole household believed in the Lord. And many of the Corinthians who heard the message believed and were baptized.
</p>

<p>
<a id="18-9"></a> <b>9</b> One night the Lord spoke to Paul in a vision: “Do not be afraid; keep on speaking; do not be silent. 
<a id="18-10"></a> <b>10</b> For I am with you and no one will lay a hand on you, because I have many people in this city.” 
<a id="18-11"></a> <b>11</b> So Paul stayed for a year and a half, teaching the word of God among the Corinthians.

</p>

<p>
<a id="18-14"></a> <b>14</b> But just as Paul was about to speak, Gallio told the Jews, “If this matter involved a wrongdoing or vicious crime, O Jews, it would be reasonable for me to hear your complaint. 
<a id="18-15"></a> <b>15</b> But since it is a dispute about words and names and your own law, settle it yourselves. I refuse to be a judge of such things.”

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org022b7eb">
<p>
<a id="19-21"></a> <b>21</b> After these things had happened, Paul resolved in the Spirit to go to Jerusalem after he had passed through Macedonia and Achaia. “After I have been there,” he said, “I must see Rome as well.” 
<a id="19-22"></a> <b>22</b> He sent two of his helpers, Timothy and Erastus, to Macedonia, while he stayed for a time in the province of Asia.
</p>

<p>
<a id="19-23"></a> <b>23</b> About that time there arose a great disturbance about the Way. 
<a id="19-24"></a> <b>24</b> It began with a silversmith named Demetrius who made silver shrines of Artemis, bringing much business to the craftsmen.
</p>

<p>
<a id="19-25"></a> <b>25</b> Demetrius assembled the craftsmen, along with the workmen in related trades. “Men,” he said, “you know that this business is our source of prosperity. 
<a id="19-26"></a> <b>26</b> And you can see and hear that not only in Ephesus, but in nearly the whole province of Asia, Paul has persuaded a great number of people to turn away. He says that man-made gods are no gods at all. 
<a id="19-27"></a> <b>27</b> There is danger not only that our business will fall into disrepute, but also that the temple of the great goddess Artemis will be discredited and her majesty deposed&#x2014;she who is worshiped by all the province of Asia and the whole world.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="19-28"></a> <b>28</b> When the men heard this, they were enraged and began shouting, “Great is Artemis of the Ephesians!” 
<a id="19-29"></a> <b>29</b> Soon the whole city was in disarray. They rushed together into the theatre, dragging with them Gaius and Aristarchus, Paul&rsquo;s traveling companions from Macedonia.
</p>

<p>
<a id="19-30"></a> <b>30</b> Paul wanted to go before the assembly, but the disciples would not allow him. 
<a id="19-31"></a> <b>31</b> Even some of Paul&rsquo;s friends who were officials of the province of Asia sent word to him, begging him not to venture into the theatre.
</p>

<p>
<a id="19-32"></a> <b>32</b> Meanwhile the assembly was in turmoil. Some were shouting one thing and some another, and most of them did not even know why they were there. 
<a id="19-33"></a> <b>33</b> The Jews in the crowd pushed Alexander forward to explain himself, and he motioned for silence so he could make his defense to the people. 
<a id="19-34"></a> <b>34</b> But when they realized that he was a Jew, they all shouted in unison for about two hours: “Great is Artemis of the Ephesians!”
</p>

<p>
<a id="19-35"></a> <b>35</b> Finally the city clerk quieted the crowd and declared, “Men of Ephesus, doesn&rsquo;t everyone know that the city of Ephesus is guardian of the temple of the great Artemis and of her image, which fell from heaven? 
<a id="19-36"></a> <b>36</b> Since these things are undeniable, you ought to be calm and not do anything rash. 
<a id="19-37"></a> <b>37</b> For you have brought these men here, though they have neither robbed our temple nor blasphemed our goddess.
</p>

<p>
<a id="19-38"></a> <b>38</b> So if Demetrius and his fellow craftsmen have a complaint against anyone, the courts are open and proconsuls are available. Let them bring charges against one another there. 
<a id="19-39"></a> <b>39</b> But if you are seeking anything beyond this, it must be settled in a legal assembly. 
<a id="19-40"></a> <b>40</b> For we are in jeopardy of being charged with rioting for today&rsquo;s events, and we have no justification to account for this commotion.”
</p>

<a id="20-31"></a> <b>31</b> Therefore be alert and remember that for three years I never stopped warning each of you night and day with tears.
</p>

<p>
<a id="20-32"></a> <b>32</b> And now I commit you to God and to the word of His grace, which can build you up and give you an inheritance among all who are sanctified.

<p>
<a id="20-33"></a> <b>33</b> I have not coveted anyone&rsquo;s silver or gold or clothing.

<a id="21-18"></a> <b>18</b> The next day Paul went in with us to see James, and all the elders were present. 
<a id="21-19"></a> <b>19</b> Paul greeted them and recounted one by one the things that God had done among the Gentiles through his ministry.
</p>

<p>
<a id="21-20"></a> <b>20</b> When they heard this, they glorified God. Then they said to Paul, “You see, brother, how many thousands of Jews have believed, and all of them are zealous for the law. 
<a id="21-21"></a> <b>21</b> But they are under the impression that you teach all the Jews who live among the Gentiles to forsake Moses, telling them not to circumcise their children or observe our customs. 
<a id="21-22"></a> <b>22</b> What then should we do? They will certainly hear that you have come.
</p>

<p>
<a id="21-23"></a> <b>23</b> Therefore do what we advise you. There are four men with us who have taken a vow. 
<a id="21-24"></a> <b>24</b> Take these men, purify yourself along with them, and pay their expenses so they can have their heads shaved. Then everyone will know that there is no truth to these rumors about you, but that you also live in obedience to the law.
</p>

<p>
<a id="21-25"></a> <b>25</b> As for the Gentile believers, we have written to them our decision that they must abstain from food sacrificed to idols, from blood, from the meat of strangled animals, and from sexual immorality.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="21-26"></a> <b>26</b> So the next day Paul took the men and purified himself along with them. Then he entered the temple to give notice of the date when their purification would be complete and the offering would be made for each of them.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org857cce6">
<p>
<a id="21-27"></a> <b>27</b> When the seven days were almost over, some Jews from the province of Asia saw Paul at the temple. They stirred up the whole crowd and seized him, 
<a id="21-28"></a> <b>28</b> crying out, “Men of Israel, help us! This is the man who teaches everywhere against our people and against our law and against this place. Furthermore, he has brought Greeks into the temple and defiled this holy place.” 
<a id="21-29"></a> <b>29</b> For they had previously seen Trophimus the Ephesian with him in the city, and they assumed that Paul had brought him into the temple.
</p>

<p>
<a id="21-30"></a> <b>30</b> The whole city was stirred up, and the people rushed together. They seized Paul and dragged him out of the temple, and at once the gates were shut. 
<a id="21-31"></a> <b>31</b> While they were trying to kill him, the commander of the Roman regiment received a report that all Jerusalem was in turmoil. 
<a id="21-32"></a> <b>32</b> Immediately he took some soldiers and centurions and ran down to the crowd. When the people saw the commander and the soldiers, they stopped beating Paul.
</p>

<p>
<a id="21-33"></a> <b>33</b> The commander came up and arrested Paul, ordering that he be bound with two chains. Then he asked who he was and what he had done.
</p>

<p>
<a id="21-34"></a> <b>34</b> Some in the crowd were shouting one thing, and some another. And since the commander could not get at the truth because of the uproar, he ordered that Paul be brought into the barracks. 
<a id="21-35"></a> <b>35</b> When Paul reached the steps, he had to be carried by the soldiers because of the violence of the mob. 
<a id="21-36"></a> <b>36</b> For the crowd that followed him kept shouting, “Away with him!”

<a id="21-37"></a> <b>37</b> As they were about to take Paul into the barracks, he asked the commander, “May I say something to you?”
</p>

<p>
“Do you speak Greek?” he replied.
<a id="21-38"></a> <b>38</b> “Aren&rsquo;t you the Egyptian who incited a rebellion some time ago and led four thousand members of the ‘Assassins&rsquo; into the wilderness?”
</p>

<p>
<a id="21-39"></a> <b>39</b> But Paul answered, “I am a Jew from Tarsus in Cilicia, a citizen of no ordinary city. Now I beg you to allow me to speak to the people.”

<a id="22-2"></a> <b>2</b> When they heard him speak to them in Hebrew, they became even more silent.
</p>

<p>
Then Paul declared,
<a id="22-3"></a> <b>3</b> “I am a Jew, born in Tarsus of Cilicia, but raised in this city. I was educated at the feet of Gamaliel in strict conformity to the law of our fathers. I am just as zealous for God as any of you here today.
</p>

<p>
<a id="22-4"></a> <b>4</b> I persecuted this Way even to the death, detaining both men and women and throwing them into prison, 
<a id="22-5"></a> <b>5</b> as the high priest and the whole Council can testify about me. I even obtained letters from them to their brothers in Damascus, and I was on my way to apprehend these people and bring them to Jerusalem to be punished.
</p>

<p>
<a id="22-6"></a> <b>6</b> About noon as I was approaching Damascus, suddenly a bright light from heaven flashed around me. 
<a id="22-7"></a> <b>7</b> I fell to the ground and heard a voice say to me, ‘Saul, Saul, why do you persecute Me?&rsquo;
</p>

<p>
8‘Who are You, Lord?&rsquo; I asked.
</p>

<p>
‘I am Jesus of Nazareth, whom you are persecuting,&rsquo; He replied. 
<a id="22-9"></a> <b>9</b> My companions saw the light, but they could not understand the voice of the One speaking to me.
</p>

<p>
<a id="22-10"></a> <b>10</b> Then I asked, ‘What should I do, Lord?&rsquo;
</p>

<p>
‘Get up and go into Damascus,&rsquo; He told me. ‘There you will be told all that you have been appointed to do.&rsquo;
</p>

<p>
<a id="22-11"></a> <b>11</b> Because the brilliance of the light had blinded me, my companions led me by the hand into Damascus. 
<a id="22-12"></a> <b>12</b> There a man named Ananias, a devout observer of the law who was highly regarded by all the Jews living there, 
<a id="22-13"></a> <b>13</b> came and stood beside me. ‘Brother Saul,&rsquo; he said, ‘receive your sight.&rsquo; And at that moment I could see him.
</p>

<p>
<a id="22-14"></a> <b>14</b> Then he said, ‘The God of our fathers has appointed you to know His will, and to see the Righteous One, and to hear His voice. 
<a id="22-15"></a> <b>15</b> You will be His witness to everyone of what you have seen and heard. 
<a id="22-16"></a> <b>16</b> And now what are you waiting for? Get up, be baptized, and wash your sins away, calling on His name.&rsquo;
</p>

<p>
<a id="22-17"></a> <b>17</b> Later, when I had returned to Jerusalem and was praying at the temple, I fell into a trance 
<a id="22-18"></a> <b>18</b> and saw the Lord saying to me, ‘Hurry! Leave Jerusalem quickly, because the people here will not accept your testimony about Me.&rsquo;
</p>

<p>
19‘Lord,&rsquo; I answered, ‘they know very well that in one synagogue after another I imprisoned and beat those who believed in You. 
<a id="22-20"></a> <b>20</b> And when the blood of Your witness Stephen was shed, I stood there giving my approval and watching over the garments of those who killed him.&rsquo;

<p>
<a id="22-22"></a> <b>22</b> The crowd listened to Paul until he made this statement. Then they lifted up their voices and shouted, “Rid the earth of him! He is not fit to live!”
</p>

<p>
<a id="22-23"></a> <b>23</b> As they were shouting and throwing off their cloaks and tossing dust into the air, 
<a id="22-24"></a> <b>24</b> the commander ordered that Paul be brought into the barracks. He directed that Paul be flogged and interrogated to determine the reason for this outcry against him.
</p>

<p>
<a id="22-25"></a> <b>25</b> But as they stretched him out to strap him down, Paul said to the centurion standing there, “Is it lawful for you to flog a Roman citizen without a trial?”
</p>

<p>
<a id="22-26"></a> <b>26</b> On hearing this, the centurion went and reported it to the commander. “What are you going to do?” he said. “This man is a Roman citizen.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="22-27"></a> <b>27</b> The commander went to Paul and asked, “Tell me, are you a Roman citizen?”
</p>

<p>
“Yes,” he answered.
</p>

<p>
<a id="22-28"></a> <b>28</b> “I paid a high price for my citizenship,” said the commander.
</p>

<p>
“But I was born a citizen,” Paul replied.
</p>

<p>
<a id="22-29"></a> <b>29</b> Then those who were about to interrogate Paul stepped back, and the commander himself was alarmed when he realized that he had put a Roman citizen in chains.
</p>

<p>
<a id="22-30"></a> <b>30</b> The next day the commander, wanting to learn the real reason Paul was accused by the Jews, released him and ordered the chief priests and the whole Sanhedrin to assemble. Then he brought Paul down and had him stand before them.

</p>

<p>
<a id="23-2"></a> <b>2</b> At this, the high priest Ananias ordered those standing near Paul to strike him on the mouth.
</p>

<p>
<a id="23-3"></a> <b>3</b> Then Paul said to him, “God will strike you, you whitewashed wall! You sit here to judge me according to the law, yet you yourself violate the law by commanding that I be struck.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="23-4"></a> <b>4</b> But those standing nearby said, “How dare you insult the high priest of God!”
</p>

<p>
<a id="23-5"></a> <b>5</b> “Brothers,” Paul replied, “I was not aware that he was the high priest, for it is written: ‘Do not speak evil about the ruler of your people.&rsquo;”
</p>

<p>
<a id="23-6"></a> <b>6</b> Then Paul, knowing that some of them were Sadducees and others Pharisees, called out in the Sanhedrin, “Brothers, I am a Pharisee, the son of a Pharisee. It is because of my hope in the resurrection of the dead that I am on trial.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="23-7"></a> <b>7</b> As soon as he had said this, a dispute broke out between the Pharisees and Sadducees, and the assembly was divided. 
<a id="23-8"></a> <b>8</b> For the Sadducees say that there is neither a resurrection, nor angels, nor spirits, but the Pharisees acknowledge them all.
</p>

<p>
<a id="23-9"></a> <b>9</b> A great clamor arose, and some scribes from the party of the Pharisees got up and contended sharply, “We find nothing wrong with this man. What if a spirit or an angel has spoken to him?” 
<a id="23-10"></a> <b>10</b> The dispute grew so violent that the commander was afraid they would tear Paul to pieces. He ordered the soldiers to go down and remove him by force and bring him into the barracks.

<a id="23-12"></a> <b>12</b> When daylight came, the Jews formed a conspiracy and bound themselves with an oath not to eat or drink until they had killed Paul. 
<a id="23-13"></a> <b>13</b> More than forty of them were involved in this plot. 
<a id="23-14"></a> <b>14</b> They went to the chief priests and elders and said, “We have bound ourselves with a solemn oath not to eat anything until we have killed Paul. 
<a id="23-15"></a> <b>15</b> Now then, you and the Sanhedrin petition the commander to bring him down to you on the pretext of examining his case more carefully. We are ready to kill him on the way.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="23-16"></a> <b>16</b> But when the son of Paul&rsquo;s sister heard about the plot, he went into the barracks and told Paul. 
<a id="23-17"></a> <b>17</b> Then Paul called one of the centurions and said, “Take this young man to the commander; he has something to tell him.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="23-18"></a> <b>18</b> So the centurion took him to the commander and said, “Paul the prisoner sent and asked me to bring this young man to you. He has something to tell you.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="23-19"></a> <b>19</b> The commander took the young man by the hand, drew him aside, and asked, “What do you need to tell me?”

<p>
<a id="23-20"></a> <b>20</b> He answered, “The Jews have agreed to ask you to bring Paul to the Sanhedrin tomorrow on the pretext of acquiring more information about him. 
<a id="23-21"></a> <b>21</b> Do not let them persuade you, because more than forty men are waiting to ambush him. They have bound themselves with an oath not to eat or drink until they have killed him; they are ready now, awaiting your consent.”

<a id="23-27"></a> <b>27</b> This man was seized by the Jews, and they were about to kill him when I came with my troops to rescue him. For I had learned that he is a Roman citizen, 
<a id="23-28"></a> <b>28</b> and since I wanted to understand their charges against him, I brought him down to their Sanhedrin. 
<a id="23-29"></a> <b>29</b> I found that the accusation involved questions about their own law, but there was no charge worthy of death or imprisonment.

<a id="23-30"></a> <b>30</b> When I was informed that there was a plot against the man, I sent him to you at once. I also instructed his accusers to present their case against him before you.

<a id="23-31"></a> <b>31</b> So the soldiers followed their orders and brought Paul by night to Antipatris.

<a id="24-11"></a> <b>11</b> You can verify for yourself that no more than twelve days ago I went up to Jerusalem to worship.

<a id="24-13"></a> <b>13</b> Nor can they prove to you any of their charges against me.
</p>

<p>
<a id="24-14"></a> <b>14</b> I do confess to you, however, that I worship the God of our fathers according to the Way, which they call a sect. I believe everything that is laid down by the Law and written in the Prophets,

<a id="25-11"></a> <b>11</b> If, however, I am guilty of anything worthy of death, I do not refuse to die. But if there is no truth to their accusations against me, no one has the right to hand me over to them. I appeal to Caesar!”

<a id="25-12"></a> <b>12</b> Then Festus conferred with his council and replied, “You have appealed to Caesar. To Caesar you will go!”

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org8f94082">
<p>
<a id="25-13"></a> <b>13</b> After several days had passed, King Agrippa and Bernice came down to Caesarea to pay their respects to Festus. 
<a id="25-14"></a> <b>14</b> Since they were staying several days, Festus laid out Paul&rsquo;s case before the king: “There is a certain man whom Felix left in prison. 
<a id="25-15"></a> <b>15</b> While I was in Jerusalem, the chief priests and elders of the Jews presented their case and requested a judgment against him. 
<a id="25-16"></a> <b>16</b> I told them that it is not the Roman custom to hand a man over before he has had an opportunity to face his accusers and defend himself against their charges.
</p>

<p>
<a id="25-17"></a> <b>17</b> So when they came here with me, I did not delay. The next day I sat on the judgment seat and ordered that the man be brought in. 
<a id="25-18"></a> <b>18</b> But when his accusers rose to speak, they did not charge him with any of the crimes I had expected. 
<a id="25-19"></a> <b>19</b> They only had some contentions with him regarding their own religion and a certain Jesus who had died, but whom Paul affirmed to be alive.
</p>

<p>
<a id="25-20"></a> <b>20</b> Since I was at a loss as to how to investigate these matters, I asked if he was willing to go to Jerusalem and be tried there on these charges. 
<a id="25-21"></a> <b>21</b> But when Paul appealed to be held over for the decision of the Emperor, I ordered that he be held until I could send him to Caesar.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="25-22"></a> <b>22</b> Then Agrippa said to Festus, “I would like to hear this man myself.”
</p>

<p>
“Tomorrow you will hear him,” Festus declared.

</p>

<p>
<a id="25-24"></a> <b>24</b> Then Festus said, “King Agrippa and all who are present with us, you see this man. The whole Jewish community has petitioned me about him, both here and in Jerusalem, crying out that he ought not to live any longer. 
<a id="25-25"></a> <b>25</b> But I found he had done nothing worthy of death, and since he has now appealed to the Emperor, I decided to send him.
</p>

<p>
<a id="25-26"></a> <b>26</b> I have nothing definite to write to our sovereign one about him. Therefore I have brought him before all of you, and especially before you, King Agrippa, so that after this inquiry I may have something to write.

<p>
<span class="drop">26</span>
</p>

<p>
<a id="26-1"></a> Agrippa said to Paul, “You have permission to speak for yourself.”
</p>

<p>
Then Paul stretched out his hand and began his defense:
<a id="26-2"></a> <b>2</b> “King Agrippa, I consider myself fortunate to stand before you today to defend myself against all the accusations of the Jews, 
<a id="26-3"></a> <b>3</b> especially since you are acquainted with all the Jewish customs and controversies. I beg you, therefore, to listen to me patiently.
</p>

<p>
<a id="26-4"></a> <b>4</b> Surely all the Jews know how I have lived from the earliest days of my youth, among my own people and in Jerusalem. 
<a id="26-5"></a> <b>5</b> They have known me for a long time and can testify, if they are willing, that I lived as a Pharisee, adhering to the strictest sect of our religion.
</p>

<p>
<a id="26-6"></a> <b>6</b> And now I stand on trial because of my hope in the promise that God made to our fathers, 
<a id="26-7"></a> <b>7</b> the promise our twelve tribes are hoping to realize as they earnestly serve God day and night. It is because of this hope, O king, that I am accused by the Jews. 
<a id="26-8"></a> <b>8</b> Why would any of you consider it incredible that God raises the dead?
</p>

<p>
<a id="26-9"></a> <b>9</b> So then, I too was convinced that I ought to do all I could to oppose the name of Jesus of Nazareth. 
<a id="26-10"></a> <b>10</b> And that is what I did in Jerusalem. With authority from the chief priests I put many of the saints in prison, and when they were condemned to death, I cast my vote against them. 
<a id="26-11"></a> <b>11</b> I frequently had them punished in the synagogues, and I tried to make them blaspheme. In my raging fury against them, I even went to foreign cities to persecute them.
</p>

<p>
<a id="26-12"></a> <b>12</b> In this pursuit I was on my way to Damascus with the authority and commission of the chief priests. 
<a id="26-13"></a> <b>13</b> About noon, O king, as I was on the road, I saw a light from heaven, brighter than the sun, shining around me and my companions. 
<a id="26-14"></a> <b>14</b> We all fell to the ground, and I heard a voice say to me in Hebrew, ‘Saul, Saul, why do you persecute Me? It is hard for you to kick against the goads.&rsquo;
</p>

<p>
15‘Who are You, Lord?&rsquo; I asked.
</p>

<p>
‘I am Jesus, whom you are persecuting,&rsquo; the Lord replied. 16‘But get up and stand on your feet. For I have appeared to you to appoint you as a servant and as a witness of what you have seen from Me and what I will show you. 
<a id="26-17"></a> <b>17</b> I will rescue you from your own people and from the Gentiles. I am sending you to them 
<a id="26-18"></a> <b>18</b> to open their eyes, so that they may turn from darkness to light and from the power of Satan to God, that they may receive forgiveness of sins and an inheritance among those sanctified by faith in Me.&rsquo;
</p>

<p>
<a id="26-19"></a> <b>19</b> So then, King Agrippa, I was not disobedient to the heavenly vision. 
<a id="26-20"></a> <b>20</b> First to those in Damascus and Jerusalem, then to everyone in the region of Judea, and then to the Gentiles, I declared that they should repent and turn to God, performing deeds worthy of their repentance. 
<a id="26-21"></a> <b>21</b> For this reason the Jews seized me in the temple courts and tried to kill me.
</p>

<p>
<a id="26-22"></a> <b>22</b> But I have had God&rsquo;s help to this day, and I stand here to testify to small and great alike. I am saying nothing beyond what the prophets and Moses said would happen: 
<a id="26-23"></a> <b>23</b> that the Christ would suffer, and as the first to rise from the dead, would proclaim light to our people and to the Gentiles.”

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org5d535df">

<a id="26-24"></a> <b>24</b> At this stage of Paul&rsquo;s defense, Festus exclaimed in a loud voice, “You are insane, Paul! Your great learning is driving you to madness!”
</p>

<p>
<a id="26-25"></a> <b>25</b> But Paul answered, “I am not insane, most excellent Festus; I am speaking words of truth and sobriety. 
<a id="26-26"></a> <b>26</b> For the king knows about these matters, and I can speak freely to him. I am confident that none of this has escaped his notice, because it was not done in a corner. 
<a id="26-27"></a> <b>27</b> King Agrippa, do you believe the prophets? I know you do.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="26-28"></a> <b>28</b> Then Agrippa said to Paul, “Can you persuade me in such a short time to become a Christian?”
</p>

<p>
<a id="26-29"></a> <b>29</b> “Short time or long,” Paul replied, “I wish to God that not only you but all who hear me this day may become what I am, except for these chains.”

<p>
<a id="26-30"></a> <b>30</b> Then the king and the governor rose, along with Bernice and those seated with them.

<p>
<a id="27-1"></a> When it was decided that we would sail for Italy, Paul and some other prisoners were handed over to a centurion named Julius, who belonged to the Imperial Regiment. 
<a id="27-2"></a> <b>2</b> We boarded an Adramyttian ship about to sail for ports along the coast of Asia, and we put out to sea. Aristarchus, a Macedonian from Thessalonica, was with us.
</p>

<p>
<a id="27-3"></a> <b>3</b> The next day we landed at Sidon, and Julius treated Paul with consideration, allowing him to visit his friends and receive their care. 
<a id="27-4"></a> <b>4</b> After putting out from there, we sailed to the lee of Cyprus because the winds were against us. 
<a id="27-5"></a> <b>5</b> And when we had sailed across the open sea off the coast of Cilicia and Pamphylia, we came to Myra in Lycia. 
<a id="27-6"></a> <b>6</b> There the centurion found an Alexandrian ship sailing for Italy and put us on board.
</p>

<p>
<a id="27-7"></a> <b>7</b> After sailing slowly for many days, we arrived off Cnidus. When the wind impeded us, we sailed to the lee of Crete, opposite Salmone. 
<a id="27-8"></a> <b>8</b> After we had moved along the coast with difficulty, we came to a place called Fair Havens, near the town of Lasea.
</p>

<p>
<a id="27-9"></a> <b>9</b> By now much time had passed, and the voyage had already become dangerous because it was after the Fast. So Paul advised them,
<a id="27-10"></a> <b>10</b> “Men, I can see that our voyage will be filled with disaster and great loss, not only to ship and cargo, but to our own lives as well.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="27-11"></a> <b>11</b> But contrary to Paul&rsquo;s advice, the centurion was persuaded by the pilot and by the owner of the ship. 
<a id="27-12"></a> <b>12</b> Since the harbor was unsuitable to winter in, the majority decided to sail on, if somehow they could reach Phoenix to winter there. Phoenix was a harbor in Crete facing both southwest and northwest.

<a id="27-13"></a> <b>13</b> When a gentle south wind began to blow, they thought they had their opportunity. So they weighed anchor and sailed along, hugging the coast of Crete. 
<a id="27-14"></a> <b>14</b> But it was not long before a cyclone called the Northeaster swept down across the island. 
<a id="27-15"></a> <b>15</b> Unable to head into the wind, the ship was caught up. So we gave way and let ourselves be driven along.
</p>

<p>
<a id="27-16"></a> <b>16</b> Passing to the lee of a small island called Cauda, we barely managed to secure the lifeboat. 
<a id="27-17"></a> <b>17</b> After hoisting it up, the crew used ropes to undergird the ship. And fearing that they would run aground on the sandbars of Syrtis, they lowered the sea anchor and were driven along.
</p>

<p>
<a id="27-18"></a> <b>18</b> We were tossed so violently that the next day the men began to jettison the cargo. 
<a id="27-19"></a> <b>19</b> On the third day, they threw the ship&rsquo;s tackle overboard with their own hands. 
<a id="27-20"></a> <b>20</b> When neither sun nor stars appeared for many days and the great storm continued to batter us, we abandoned all hope of being saved.
</p>

<p>
<a id="27-21"></a> <b>21</b> After the men had gone a long time without food, Paul stood up among them and said, “Men, you should have followed my advice not to sail from Crete. Then you would have averted this disaster and loss. 
<a id="27-22"></a> <b>22</b> But now I urge you to keep up your courage, because you will not experience any loss of life, but only of the ship. 
<a id="27-23"></a> <b>23</b> For just last night an angel of God, whose I am and whom I serve, stood beside me 
<a id="27-24"></a> <b>24</b> and said, ‘Do not be afraid, Paul; you must stand before Caesar. And look, God has granted you the lives of all who sail with you.&rsquo;
</p>

<p>
<a id="27-25"></a> <b>25</b> So take courage, men, for I believe God that it will happen just as He told me.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org8807d02">
<p>
<a id="27-27"></a> <b>27</b> On the fourteenth night we were still being driven across the Adriatic Sea. About midnight the sailors sensed they were approaching land. 
<a id="27-28"></a> <b>28</b> They took soundings and found that the water was twenty fathoms deep. Going a little farther, they took another set of soundings that read fifteen fathoms. 
<a id="27-29"></a> <b>29</b> Fearing that we would run aground on the rocks, they dropped four anchors from the stern and prayed for daybreak.
</p>

<p>
<a id="27-30"></a> <b>30</b> Meanwhile, the sailors attempted to escape from the ship. Pretending to lower anchors from the bow, they let the lifeboat down into the sea. 
<a id="27-31"></a> <b>31</b> But Paul said to the centurion and the soldiers, “Unless these men remain with the ship, you cannot be saved.” 
<a id="27-32"></a> <b>32</b> So the soldiers cut the ropes to the lifeboat and set it adrift.
</p>

<p>
<a id="27-33"></a> <b>33</b> Right up to daybreak, Paul kept urging them all to eat: “Today is your fourteenth day in constant suspense, without taking any food. 
<a id="27-34"></a> <b>34</b> So for your own preservation, I urge you to eat something, because not a single hair of your head will be lost.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="27-35"></a> <b>35</b> After he had said this, Paul took bread and gave thanks to God in front of them all. Then he broke it and began to eat. 
<a id="27-36"></a> <b>36</b> They were all encouraged and took some food themselves. 
<a id="27-37"></a> <b>37</b> In all, there were 276 of us on board. 
<a id="27-38"></a> <b>38</b> After the men had eaten their fill, they lightened the ship by throwing the grain into the sea.
</p>

<p>
<a id="27-39"></a> <b>39</b> When daylight came, they did not recognize the land, but they sighted a bay with a sandy beach, where they decided to run the ship aground if they could. 
<a id="27-40"></a> <b>40</b> Cutting away the anchors, they left them in the sea as they loosened the ropes that held the rudders. Then they hoisted the foresail to the wind and made for the beach. 
<a id="27-41"></a> <b>41</b> But the vessel struck a sandbar and ran aground. The bow stuck fast and would not move, and the stern was being broken up by the pounding of the waves.
</p>

<p>
<a id="27-42"></a> <b>42</b> The soldiers planned to kill the prisoners so none of them could swim to freedom. 
<a id="27-43"></a> <b>43</b> But the centurion, wanting to spare Paul&rsquo;s life, thwarted their plan. He commanded those who could swim to jump overboard first and get to land. 
<a id="27-44"></a> <b>44</b> The rest were to follow on planks and various parts of the ship. In this way everyone was brought safely to land.

<p>
<a id="28-3"></a> <b>3</b> Paul gathered a bundle of sticks, and as he laid them on the fire, a viper, driven out by the heat, fastened itself to his hand. 
<a id="28-4"></a> <b>4</b> When the islanders saw the creature hanging from his hand, they said to one another, “Surely this man is a murderer. Although he was saved from the sea, Justice has not allowed him to live.” 
<a id="28-5"></a> <b>5</b> But Paul shook the creature off into the fire and suffered no ill effects. 
<a id="28-6"></a> <b>6</b> The islanders were expecting him to swell up or suddenly drop dead. But after waiting a long time and seeing nothing unusual happen to him, they changed their minds and said he was a god.

<a id="28-8"></a> <b>8</b> The father of Publius was sick in bed, suffering from fever and dysentery. Paul went in to see him, and after praying and placing his hands on him, he healed the man.

</p>

<p>
<a id="28-17"></a> <b>17</b> After three days, he called together the leaders of the Jews. When they had gathered, he said to them, “Brothers, although I have done nothing against our people or the customs of our fathers, I was taken prisoner in Jerusalem and handed over to the Romans. 
<a id="28-18"></a> <b>18</b> They examined me and wanted to release me, because there was no basis for a death sentence against me. 
<a id="28-19"></a> <b>19</b> But when the Jews objected, I was compelled to appeal to Caesar, even though I have no charge to bring against my nation. 
<a id="28-20"></a> <b>20</b> So for this reason I have called to see you and speak with you. It is because of the hope of Israel that I am bound with this chain.”

<p>
<a id="1-1"></a> These are the words of Amos, who was among the sheepherders of Tekoa&#x2014;what he saw concerning Israel two years before the earthquake, in the days when Uzziah was king of Judah and Jeroboam son of Jehoash was king of Israel. 
<a id="1-2"></a> <b>2</b> He said:
</p>

<p>
“The LORD roars from Zion
</p>

<p>
and raises His voice from Jerusalem;
</p>

<p>
the pastures of the shepherds mourn,
</p>

<p>
and the summit of Carmel withers.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="1-3"></a> <b>3</b> This is what the LORD says:
</p>

<p>
“For three transgressions of Damascus, even four,
</p>

<p>
I will not revoke My judgment,
</p>

<p>
because they threshed Gilead
</p>

<p>
with sledges of iron.
</p>

<p>
<a id="1-4"></a> <b>4</b> So I will send fire upon the house of Hazael
</p>

<p>
to consume the citadels of Ben-hadad.
</p>

<p>
<a id="1-5"></a> <b>5</b> I will break down the gates of Damascus;
</p>

<p>
I will cut off the ruler of the Valley of Aven
</p>

<p>
and the one who wields the scepter in Beth-eden.
</p>

<p>
The people of Aram will be exiled to Kir,”
</p>

<p>
says the LORD.
</p>

<p>
<a id="1-6"></a> <b>6</b> This is what the LORD says:
</p>

<p>
“For three transgressions of Gaza, even four,
</p>

<p>
I will not revoke My judgment,
</p>

<p>
because they exiled a whole population,
</p>

<p>
delivering them up to Edom.
</p>

<p>
<a id="1-7"></a> <b>7</b> So I will send fire upon the walls of Gaza,

I will turn My hand against Ekron,

<p>
and the remnant of the Philistines will perish,”

says the Lord GOD.

<p>
“For three transgressions of Tyre, even four,

I will not revoke My judgment,

because they delivered up a whole congregation of exiles to Edom

<p>
“For three transgressions of Edom, even four,
</p>

<p>
I will not revoke My judgment,
</p>

<p>
because he pursued his brother with the sword
</p>

<p>
and stifled all compassion;
</p>

<p>
his anger raged continually,
</p>

<p>
and his fury flamed incessantly.
</p>

<p>
<a id="1-12"></a> <b>12</b> So I will send fire upon Teman
</p>

<p>
to consume the citadels of Bozrah.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="1-13"></a> <b>13</b> This is what the LORD says:
</p>

<p>
“For three transgressions of the Ammonites, even four,
</p>

<p>
I will not revoke My judgment,
</p>

<p>
because they ripped open the pregnant women of Gilead
</p>

<p>
in order to enlarge their territory.

and a violent wind on the day of tempest.

</p>

<p>
If calamity comes to a city,

has not the LORD caused it?

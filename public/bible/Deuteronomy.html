<a id="1-1"></a> These are the words that Moses spoke to all Israel in the wilderness east of the Jordan&#x2014;in the Arabah opposite Suph&#x2014;between Paran and Tophel, Laban, Hazeroth, and Dizahab.
</p>

<p>
<a id="1-2"></a> <b>2</b> It is an eleven-day journey from Horeb to Kadesh-barnea by way of Mount Seir. 
<a id="1-3"></a> <b>3</b> In the fortieth year, on the first day of the eleventh month, Moses proclaimed to the Israelites all that the LORD had commanded him concerning them. 
<a id="1-4"></a> <b>4</b> This was after he had defeated Sihon king of the Amorites, who lived in Heshbon, and then at Edrei had defeated Og king of Bashan, who lived in Ashtaroth.
</p>

<p>
<a id="1-5"></a> <b>5</b> On the east side of the Jordan in the land of Moab, Moses began to explain this law, saying:
</p>

<p>
<a id="1-6"></a> <b>6</b> The LORD our God said to us at Horeb: “You have stayed at this mountain long enough. 
<a id="1-7"></a> <b>7</b> Resume your journey and go to the hill country of the Amorites; go to all the neighboring peoples in the Arabah, in the hill country, in the foothills, in the Negev, and along the seacoast to the land of the Canaanites and to Lebanon, as far as the great River Euphrates.
</p>

<p>
<a id="1-8"></a> <b>8</b> See, I have placed the land before you. Enter and possess the land that the LORD swore He would give to your fathers Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and to their descendants after them.”

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orga0a8e7f">
<p>
<a id="1-9"></a> <b>9</b> At that time I said to you, “I cannot carry the burden for you alone. 
<a id="1-10"></a> <b>10</b> The LORD your God has multiplied you, so that today you are as numerous as the stars in the sky. 
<a id="1-11"></a> <b>11</b> May the LORD, the God of your fathers, increase you a thousand times over and bless you as He has promised. 
<a id="1-12"></a> <b>12</b> But how can I bear your troubles, burdens, and disputes all by myself? 
<a id="1-13"></a> <b>13</b> Choose for yourselves wise, understanding, and respected men from each of your tribes, and I will appoint them as your leaders.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="1-14"></a> <b>14</b> And you answered me and said, “What you propose to do is good.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="1-15"></a> <b>15</b> So I took the leaders of your tribes, wise and respected men, and appointed them as leaders over you&#x2014;as commanders of thousands, of hundreds, of fifties, and of tens, and as officers for your tribes.
</p>

<p>
<a id="1-16"></a> <b>16</b> At that time I charged your judges: “Hear the disputes between your brothers, and judge fairly between a man and his brother or a foreign resident. 
<a id="1-17"></a> <b>17</b> Show no partiality in judging; hear both small and great alike. Do not be intimidated by anyone, for judgment belongs to God. And bring to me any case too difficult for you, and I will hear it.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="1-18"></a> <b>18</b> And at that time I commanded you all the things you were to do.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orge225748">
<p>
<a id="1-19"></a> <b>19</b> And just as the LORD our God had commanded us, we set out from Horeb and went toward the hill country of the Amorites, through all the vast and terrifying wilderness you have seen. When we reached Kadesh-barnea, 
<a id="1-20"></a> <b>20</b> I said: “You have reached the hill country of the Amorites, which the LORD our God is giving us. 
<a id="1-21"></a> <b>21</b> See, the LORD your God has placed the land before you. Go up and take possession of it as the LORD, the God of your fathers, has told you. Do not be afraid or discouraged.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="1-22"></a> <b>22</b> Then all of you approached me and said, “Let us send men ahead of us to search out the land and bring us word of what route to follow and which cities to enter.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="1-23"></a> <b>23</b> The plan seemed good to me, so I selected twelve men from among you, one from each tribe. 
<a id="1-24"></a> <b>24</b> They left and went up into the hill country, and came to the Valley of Eshcol and spied out the land. 
<a id="1-25"></a> <b>25</b> They took some of the fruit of the land in their hands, carried it down to us, and brought us word: “It is a good land that the LORD our God is giving us.”

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org71dd0c0">
<p>
<a id="1-26"></a> <b>26</b> But you were unwilling to go up; you rebelled against the command of the LORD your God. 
<a id="1-27"></a> <b>27</b> You grumbled in your tents and said, “Because the LORD hates us, He has brought us out of the land of Egypt to deliver us into the hand of the Amorites to be annihilated. 
<a id="1-28"></a> <b>28</b> Where can we go? Our brothers have made our hearts melt, saying: ‘The people are larger and taller than we are; the cities are large, with walls up to the heavens. We even saw the descendants of the Anakim there.&rsquo; ”
</p>

<p>
<a id="1-29"></a> <b>29</b> So I said to you: “Do not be terrified or afraid of them! 
<a id="1-30"></a> <b>30</b> The LORD your God, who goes before you, will fight for you, just as you saw Him do for you in Egypt 
<a id="1-31"></a> <b>31</b> and in the wilderness, where the LORD your God carried you, as a man carries his son, all the way by which you traveled until you reached this place.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="1-32"></a> <b>32</b> But in spite of all this, you did not trust the LORD your God, 
<a id="1-33"></a> <b>33</b> who went before you on the journey, in the fire by night and in the cloud by day, to seek out a place for you to camp and to show you the road to travel.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orge32e24f">
<p>
<a id="1-34"></a> <b>34</b> When the LORD heard your words, He grew angry and swore an oath, saying,
<a id="1-35"></a> <b>35</b> “Not one of the men of this evil generation shall see the good land I swore to give your fathers, 
<a id="1-36"></a> <b>36</b> except Caleb son of Jephunneh. He will see it, and I will give him and his descendants the land on which he has set foot, because he followed the LORD wholeheartedly.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="1-37"></a> <b>37</b> The LORD was also angry with me on your account, and He said, “Not even you shall enter the land. 
<a id="1-38"></a> <b>38</b> Joshua son of Nun, who stands before you, will enter it. Encourage him, for he will enable Israel to inherit the land. 
<a id="1-39"></a> <b>39</b> And the little ones you said would become captives&#x2014;your children who on that day did not know good from evil&#x2014;will enter the land that I will give them, and they will possess it.

<p>
<a id="1-41"></a> <b>41</b> “We have sinned against the LORD,” you replied. “We will go up and fight, as the LORD our God has commanded us.” Then each of you put on his weapons of war, thinking it easy to go up into the hill country.
</p>

<p>
<a id="1-42"></a> <b>42</b> But the LORD said to me, “Tell them not to go up and fight, for I am not with you to keep you from defeat by your enemies.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="1-43"></a> <b>43</b> So I spoke to you, but you would not listen. You rebelled against the command of the LORD and presumptuously went up into the hill country.
</p>

<p>
<a id="1-44"></a> <b>44</b> Then the Amorites who lived in the hills came out against you and chased you like a swarm of bees. They routed you from Seir all the way to Hormah. 
<a id="1-45"></a> <b>45</b> And you returned and wept before the LORD, but He would not listen to your voice or give ear to you.
</p>

<p>

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org6dcf12e">
<p>
<span class="drop">2</span>
</p>

<p>
<a id="2-1"></a> Then we turned back and headed for the wilderness by way of the Red Sea, as the LORD had instructed me, and for many days we wandered around Mount Seir.
</p>

<p>
<a id="2-2"></a> <b>2</b> At this time the LORD said to me,
<a id="2-3"></a> <b>3</b> “You have been wandering around this hill country long enough; turn to the north 
<a id="2-4"></a> <b>4</b> and command the people: ‘You will pass through the territory of your brothers, the descendants of Esau, who live in Seir. They will be afraid of you, so you must be very careful. 
<a id="2-5"></a> <b>5</b> Do not provoke them, for I will not give you any of their land, not even a footprint, because I have given Mount Seir to Esau as his possession. 
<a id="2-6"></a> <b>6</b> You are to pay them in silver for the food you eat and the water you drink.&rsquo; ”
</p>

<p>
<a id="2-7"></a> <b>7</b> Indeed, the LORD your God has blessed you in all the work of your hands. He has watched over your journey through this vast wilderness. The LORD your God has been with you these forty years, and you have lacked nothing.
</p>

<p>
<a id="2-8"></a> <b>8</b> So we passed by our brothers, the descendants of Esau, who live in Seir. We turned away from the Arabah road, which comes up from Elath and Ezion-geber, and traveled along the road of the Wilderness of Moab. 
<a id="2-9"></a> <b>9</b> Then the LORD said to me, “Do not harass the Moabites or provoke them to war, for I will not give you any of their land, because I have given Ar to the descendants of Lot as their possession.”
</p>

<p>
10(The Emites used to live there, a people great and many, as tall as the Anakites. 
<a id="2-11"></a> <b>11</b> Like the Anakites, they were also regarded as Rephaim, though the Moabites called them Emites. 
<a id="2-12"></a> <b>12</b> The Horites used to live in Seir, but the descendants of Esau drove them out. They destroyed the Horites from before them and settled in their place, just as Israel did in the land that the LORD gave them as their possession.)
</p>

<p>
<a id="2-13"></a> <b>13</b> “Now arise and cross over the Brook of Zered.”
</p>

<p>
So we crossed over the Brook of Zered.
</p>

<p>
<a id="2-14"></a> <b>14</b> The time we spent traveling from Kadesh-barnea until we crossed over the Brook of Zered was thirty-eight years, until that entire generation of fighting men had perished from the camp, as the LORD had sworn to them. 
<a id="2-15"></a> <b>15</b> Indeed, the LORD&rsquo;s hand was against them, to eliminate them from the camp, until they had all perished.
</p>

<p>
<a id="2-16"></a> <b>16</b> Now when all the fighting men among the people had died, 
<a id="2-17"></a> <b>17</b> the LORD said to me,
<a id="2-18"></a> <b>18</b> “Today you are going to cross the border of Moab at Ar. 
<a id="2-19"></a> <b>19</b> But when you get close to the Ammonites, do not harass them or provoke them, for I will not give you any of the land of the Ammonites. I have given it to the descendants of Lot as their possession.”
</p>

<p>
20(That too was regarded as the land of the Rephaim, who used to live there, though the Ammonites called them Zamzummites. 
<a id="2-21"></a> <b>21</b> They were a people great and many, as tall as the Anakites. But the LORD destroyed them from before the Ammonites, who drove them out and settled in their place, 
<a id="2-22"></a> <b>22</b> just as He had done for the descendants of Esau who lived in Seir, when He destroyed the Horites from before them. They drove them out and have lived in their place to this day. 
<a id="2-23"></a> <b>23</b> And the Avvim, who lived in villages as far as Gaza, were destroyed by the Caphtorites, who came out of Caphtor and settled in their place.)

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org24b937f">
<p>
<a id="2-24"></a> <b>24</b> “Arise, set out, and cross the Arnon Valley. See, I have delivered into your hand Sihon the Amorite, king of Heshbon, and his land. Begin to take possession of it and engage him in battle. 
<a id="2-25"></a> <b>25</b> This very day I will begin to put the dread and fear of you upon all the nations under heaven. They will hear the reports of you and tremble in anguish because of you.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="2-26"></a> <b>26</b> So from the Wilderness of Kedemoth I sent messengers with an offer of peace to Sihon king of Heshbon, saying,
<a id="2-27"></a> <b>27</b> “Let us pass through your land; we will stay on the main road. We will not turn to the right or to the left. 
<a id="2-28"></a> <b>28</b> You can sell us food to eat and water to drink in exchange for silver. Only let us pass through on foot, 
<a id="2-29"></a> <b>29</b> just as the descendants of Esau who live in Seir and the Moabites who live in Ar did for us, until we cross the Jordan into the land that the LORD our God is giving us.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="2-30"></a> <b>30</b> But Sihon king of Heshbon would not let us pass through, for the LORD your God had made his spirit stubborn and his heart obstinate, that He might deliver him into your hand, as is the case this day.
</p>

<p>
<a id="2-31"></a> <b>31</b> Then the LORD said to me, “See, I have begun to deliver Sihon and his land over to you. Now begin to conquer and possess his land.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="2-32"></a> <b>32</b> So Sihon and his whole army came out for battle against us at Jahaz. 
<a id="2-33"></a> <b>33</b> And the LORD our God delivered him over to us, and we defeated him and his sons and his whole army.
</p>

<p>
<a id="2-34"></a> <b>34</b> At that time we captured all his cities and devoted to destruction the people of every city, including women and children. We left no survivors. 
<a id="2-35"></a> <b>35</b> We carried off for ourselves only the livestock and the plunder from the cities we captured.
</p>

<p>
<a id="2-36"></a> <b>36</b> From Aroer on the rim of the Arnon Valley, along with the city in the valley, even as far as Gilead, not one city had walls too high for us. The LORD our God gave us all of them. 
<a id="2-37"></a> <b>37</b> But you did not go near the land of the Ammonites, or the land along the banks of the Jabbok River, or the cities of the hill country, or any place that the LORD our God had forbidden.

<a id="3-2"></a> <b>2</b> But the LORD said to me, “Do not fear him, for I have delivered him into your hand, along with all his people and his land. Do to him as you did to Sihon king of the Amorites, who lived in Heshbon.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="3-3"></a> <b>3</b> So the LORD our God also delivered Og king of Bashan and his whole army into our hands. We struck them down until no survivor was left.
</p>

<p>
<a id="3-4"></a> <b>4</b> At that time we captured all sixty of his cities. There was not a single city we failed to take&#x2014;the entire region of Argob, the kingdom of Og in Bashan. 
<a id="3-5"></a> <b>5</b> All these cities were fortified with high walls and gates and bars, and there were many more unwalled villages. 
<a id="3-6"></a> <b>6</b> We devoted them to destruction, as we had done to Sihon king of Heshbon, utterly destroying the men, women, and children of every city.

<a id="3-7"></a> <b>7</b> But all the livestock and plunder of the cities we carried off for ourselves.

<p>
<a id="3-8"></a> <b>8</b> At that time we took from the two kings of the Amorites the land across the Jordan, from the Arnon Valley as far as Mount Hermon&#x2014; 
<a id="3-9"></a> <b>9</b> which the Sidonians call Sirion but the Amorites call Senir&#x2014; 
<a id="3-10"></a> <b>10</b> all the cities of the plateau, all of Gilead, and all of Bashan as far as the cities of Salecah and Edrei in the kingdom of Og.

<a id="3-12"></a> <b>12</b> So at that time we took possession of this land. To the Reubenites and Gadites I gave the land beyond Aroer along the Arnon Valley, and half the hill country of Gilead, along with its cities.
</p>

<p>
<a id="3-13"></a> <b>13</b> To the half-tribe of Manasseh I gave the rest of Gilead and all of Bashan, the kingdom of Og. (The entire region of Argob, the whole territory of Bashan, used to be called the land of the Rephaim.) 
<a id="3-14"></a> <b>14</b> Jair, a descendant of Manasseh, took the whole region of Argob as far as the border of the Geshurites and Maacathites. He renamed Bashan after himself, Havvoth-jair, by which it is called to this day.
</p>

<p>
<a id="3-15"></a> <b>15</b> To Machir I gave Gilead, 
<a id="3-16"></a> <b>16</b> and to the Reubenites and Gadites I gave the territory from Gilead to the Arnon Valley (the middle of the valley was the border) and up to the Jabbok River, the border of the Ammonites. 
<a id="3-17"></a> <b>17</b> The Jordan River in the Arabah bordered it from Chinnereth to the Sea of the Arabah (the Salt Sea) with the slopes of Pisgah to the east.

</p>

<p>
<a id="4-5"></a> <b>5</b> See, I have taught you statutes and ordinances just as the LORD my God has commanded me, so that you may follow them in the land that you are about to enter and possess. 
<a id="4-6"></a> <b>6</b> Observe them carefully, for this will show your wisdom and understanding in the sight of the peoples, who will hear of all these statutes and say, “Surely this great nation is a wise and understanding people.”

</p>

<p>
<a id="4-9"></a> <b>9</b> Only be on your guard and diligently watch yourselves, so that you do not forget the things your eyes have seen, and so that they do not slip from your heart as long as you live. Teach them to your children and grandchildren.

<p>
<a id="4-11"></a> <b>11</b> You came near and stood at the base of the mountain, a mountain blazing with fire to the heavens, with black clouds and deep darkness. 
<a id="4-12"></a> <b>12</b> And the LORD spoke to you out of the fire. You heard the sound of the words, but saw no form; there was only a voice. 
<a id="4-13"></a> <b>13</b> He declared to you His covenant, which He commanded you to follow&#x2014;the Ten Commandments that He wrote on two tablets of stone.
</p>

<a id="4-14"></a> <b>14</b> At that time the LORD commanded me to teach you the statutes and ordinances you are to follow in the land that you are crossing the Jordan to possess.

<h3 id="org60ad278">A Warning against Idolatry (Deuteronomy 12:29&#x2013;32; Ezekiel 6:1&#x2013;7)</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org60ad278">
<p>
<a id="4-15"></a> <b>15</b> So since you saw no form of any kind on the day the LORD spoke to you out of the fire at Horeb, be careful 
<a id="4-16"></a> <b>16</b> that you do not act corruptly and make an idol for yourselves of any form or shape, whether in the likeness of a male or female, 
<a id="4-17"></a> <b>17</b> of any beast that is on the earth or bird that flies in the air, 
<a id="4-18"></a> <b>18</b> or of any creature that crawls on the ground or fish that is in the waters below.
</p>

<p>
<a id="4-19"></a> <b>19</b> When you look to the heavens and see the sun and moon and stars&#x2014;all the host of heaven&#x2014;do not be enticed to bow down and worship what the LORD your God has apportioned to all the nations under heaven. 
<a id="4-20"></a> <b>20</b> Yet the LORD has taken you and brought you out of the iron furnace, out of Egypt, to be the people of His inheritance, as you are today.
</p>

<p>
<a id="4-21"></a> <b>21</b> The LORD, however, was angry with me on account of you, and He swore that I would not cross the Jordan to enter the good land that the LORD your God is giving you as an inheritance. 
<a id="4-22"></a> <b>22</b> For I will not be crossing the Jordan, because I must die in this land. But you shall cross over and take possession of that good land.
</p>

<p>
<a id="4-23"></a> <b>23</b> Be careful that you do not forget the covenant of the LORD your God that He made with you; do not make an idol for yourselves in the form of anything He has forbidden you. 
<a id="4-24"></a> <b>24</b> For the LORD your God is a consuming fire, a jealous God.
</p>

<p>
<a id="4-25"></a> <b>25</b> After you have children and grandchildren and you have been in the land a long time, if you then act corruptly and make an idol of any form&#x2014;doing evil in the sight of the LORD your God and provoking Him to anger&#x2014; 
<a id="4-26"></a> <b>26</b> I call heaven and earth as witnesses against you this day that you will quickly perish from the land that you are crossing the Jordan to possess. You will not live long upon it, but will be utterly destroyed.
</p>

<p>
<a id="4-27"></a> <b>27</b> Then the LORD will scatter you among the peoples, and only a few of you will survive among the nations to which the LORD will drive you. 
<a id="4-28"></a> <b>28</b> And there you will serve man-made gods of wood and stone, which cannot see or hear or eat or smell.
</p>

<p>
<a id="4-29"></a> <b>29</b> But if from there you will seek the LORD your God, you will find Him if you seek Him with all your heart and with all your soul. 
<a id="4-30"></a> <b>30</b> When you are in distress and all these things have happened to you, then in later days you will return to the LORD your God and listen to His voice. 
<a id="4-31"></a> <b>31</b> For the LORD your God is a merciful God; He will not abandon you or destroy you or forget the covenant with your fathers, which He swore to them by oath.

<a id="4-32"></a> <b>32</b> Indeed, ask now from one end of the heavens to the other about the days that long preceded you, from the day that God created man on earth: Has anything as great as this ever happened or been reported? 
<a id="4-33"></a> <b>33</b> Has a people ever heard the voice of God speaking out of the fire, as you have, and lived? 
<a id="4-34"></a> <b>34</b> Or has any god tried to take as his own a nation out of another nation&#x2014;by trials, signs, wonders, and war, by a strong hand and an outstretched arm, and by great terrors&#x2014;as the LORD your God did for you in Egypt, before your eyes?

</p>

<p>
<a id="5-7"></a> <b>7</b> You shall have no other gods before Me.

<p>
<a id="5-8"></a> <b>8</b> You shall not make for yourself an idol in the form of anything in the heavens above, on the earth below, or in the waters beneath. 
<a id="5-9"></a> <b>9</b> You shall not bow down to them or worship them; for I, the LORD your God, am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers on their children to the third and fourth generations of those who hate Me,

<a id="5-13"></a> <b>13</b> Six days you shall labor and do all your work,

<a id="8-1"></a> You must carefully follow every commandment I am giving you today, so that you may live and multiply, and enter and possess the land that the LORD swore to give your fathers. 
<a id="8-2"></a> <b>2</b> Remember that these forty years the LORD your God led you all the way in the wilderness, so that He might humble you and test you in order to know what was in your heart, whether or not you would keep His commandments.
</p>

<p>
<a id="8-3"></a> <b>3</b> He humbled you, and in your hunger He gave you manna to eat, which neither you nor your fathers had known, so that you might understand that man does not live on bread alone, but on every word that comes from the mouth of the LORD. 
<a id="8-4"></a> <b>4</b> Your clothing did not wear out and your feet did not swell during these forty years.
</p>

<p>
<a id="8-5"></a> <b>5</b> So know in your heart that just as a man disciplines his son, so the LORD your God disciplines you. 
<a id="8-6"></a> <b>6</b> Therefore you shall keep the commandments of the LORD your God, walking in His ways and fearing Him.
</p>

<p>
<a id="8-7"></a> <b>7</b> For the LORD your God is bringing you into a good land, a land of brooks and fountains and springs that flow through the valleys and hills; 
<a id="8-8"></a> <b>8</b> a land of wheat, barley, vines, fig trees, and pomegranates; a land of olive oil and honey; 
<a id="8-9"></a> <b>9</b> a land where you will eat food without scarcity, where you will lack nothing; a land whose rocks are iron and whose hills are ready to be mined for copper. 
<a id="8-10"></a> <b>10</b> When you eat and are satisfied, you are to bless the LORD your God for the good land that He has given you.
</p>

<p>
<a id="8-11"></a> <b>11</b> Be careful not to forget the LORD your God by failing to keep His commandments and ordinances and statutes, which I am giving you this day. 
<a id="8-12"></a> <b>12</b> Otherwise, when you eat and are satisfied, when you build fine houses in which to dwell, 
<a id="8-13"></a> <b>13</b> and when your herds and flocks grow large and your silver and gold increase and all that you have is multiplied, 
<a id="8-14"></a> <b>14</b> then your heart will become proud, and you will forget the LORD your God who brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of slavery.
</p>

<p>
<a id="8-15"></a> <b>15</b> He led you through the vast and terrifying wilderness with its venomous snakes and scorpions, a thirsty and waterless land. He brought you water from the rock of flint. 
<a id="8-16"></a> <b>16</b> He fed you in the wilderness with manna that your fathers had not known, in order to humble you and test you, so that in the end He might cause you to prosper.
</p>

<p>
<a id="8-17"></a> <b>17</b> You might say in your heart, “The power and strength of my hands have made this wealth for me.” 
<a id="8-18"></a> <b>18</b> But remember that it is the LORD your God who gives you the power to gain wealth, in order to confirm His covenant that He swore to your fathers even to this day.
</p>

<p>
<a id="8-19"></a> <b>19</b> If you ever forget the LORD your God and go after other gods to worship and bow down to them, I testify against you today that you will surely perish. 
<a id="8-20"></a> <b>20</b> Like the nations that the LORD has destroyed before you, so you will perish if you do not obey the LORD your God.

<a id="9-1"></a> Hear, O Israel: Today you are about to cross the Jordan to go in and dispossess nations greater and stronger than you, with large cities fortified to the heavens. 
<a id="9-2"></a> <b>2</b> The people are strong and tall, the descendants of the Anakim. You know about them, and you have heard it said, “Who can stand up to the sons of Anak?”

<p>
<a id="9-4"></a> <b>4</b> When the LORD your God has driven them out before you, do not say in your heart, “Because of my righteousness the LORD has brought me in to possess this land.” Rather, the LORD is driving out these nations before you because of their wickedness.
</p>

<p>
<a id="9-5"></a> <b>5</b> It is not because of your righteousness or uprightness of heart that you are going in to possess their land, but it is because of their wickedness that the LORD your God is driving out these nations before you, to keep the promise He swore to your fathers, to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. 
<a id="9-6"></a> <b>6</b> Understand, then, that it is not because of your righteousness that the LORD your God is giving you this good land to possess, for you are a stiff-necked people.

<p>
<a id="9-7"></a> <b>7</b> Remember this, and never forget how you provoked the LORD your God in the wilderness. From the day you left the land of Egypt until you reached this place, you have been rebelling against the LORD.
</p>

<p>
<a id="9-8"></a> <b>8</b> At Horeb you provoked the LORD, and He was angry enough to destroy you. 
<a id="9-9"></a> <b>9</b> When I went up on the mountain to receive the tablets of stone, the tablets of the covenant that the LORD made with you, I stayed on the mountain forty days and forty nights. I ate no bread and drank no water.
</p>

<p>
<a id="9-10"></a> <b>10</b> Then the LORD gave me the two stone tablets, inscribed by the finger of God with the exact words that the LORD spoke to you out of the fire on the mountain on the day of the assembly. 
<a id="9-11"></a> <b>11</b> And at the end of forty days and forty nights, the LORD gave me the two stone tablets, the tablets of the covenant. 
<a id="9-12"></a> <b>12</b> And the LORD said to me, “Get up and go down from here at once, for your people, whom you brought out of Egypt, have corrupted themselves. How quickly they have turned aside from the way that I commanded them! They have made for themselves a molten image.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="9-13"></a> <b>13</b> The LORD also said to me, “I have seen this people, and they are indeed a stiff-necked people. 
<a id="9-14"></a> <b>14</b> Leave Me alone, so that I may destroy them and blot out their name from under heaven. Then I will make you into a nation mightier and greater than they are.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="9-15"></a> <b>15</b> So I went back down the mountain while it was blazing with fire, with the two tablets of the covenant in my hands. 
<a id="9-16"></a> <b>16</b> And I saw how you had sinned against the LORD your God; you had made for yourselves a molten calf. You had turned aside quickly from the way that the LORD had commanded you. 
<a id="9-17"></a> <b>17</b> So I took the two tablets and threw them out of my hands, shattering them before your eyes.
</p>

<p>
<a id="9-18"></a> <b>18</b> Then I fell down before the LORD for forty days and forty nights, as I had done the first time. I did not eat bread or drink water because of all the sin you had committed in doing what was evil in the sight of the LORD and provoking Him to anger. 
<a id="9-19"></a> <b>19</b> For I was afraid of the anger and wrath that the LORD had directed against you, enough to destroy you. But the LORD listened to me this time as well.
</p>

<p>
<a id="9-20"></a> <b>20</b> The LORD was angry enough with Aaron to destroy him, but at that time I also prayed for Aaron. 
<a id="9-21"></a> <b>21</b> And I took that sinful thing, the calf you had made, and burned it in the fire. Then I crushed it and ground it to powder as fine as dust, and I cast it into the stream that came down from the mountain.
</p>

<p>
<a id="9-22"></a> <b>22</b> You continued to provoke the LORD at Taberah, at Massah, and at Kibroth-hattaavah. 
<a id="9-23"></a> <b>23</b> And when the LORD sent you out from Kadesh-barnea, He said, “Go up and possess the land that I have given you.”
</p>

<p>
But you rebelled against the command of the LORD your God. You neither believed Him nor obeyed Him. 
<a id="9-24"></a> <b>24</b> You have been rebelling against the LORD since the day I came to know you. 
<a id="9-25"></a> <b>25</b> So I fell down before the LORD for forty days and forty nights, because the LORD had said He would destroy you.
</p>

<p>
<a id="9-26"></a> <b>26</b> And I prayed to the LORD and said, “O Lord GOD, do not destroy Your people, Your inheritance, whom You redeemed through Your greatness and brought out of Egypt with a mighty hand. 
<a id="9-27"></a> <b>27</b> Remember Your servants Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. Overlook the stubbornness of this people and the wickedness of their sin. 
<a id="9-28"></a> <b>28</b> Otherwise, those in the land from which You brought us out will say, ‘Because the LORD was not able to bring them into the land He had promised them, and because He hated them, He has brought them out to kill them in the wilderness.&rsquo; 
<a id="9-29"></a> <b>29</b> But they are Your people, Your inheritance, whom You brought out by Your great power and outstretched arm.”

<a id="10-1"></a> At that time the LORD said to me, “Chisel out two stone tablets like the originals, come up to Me on the mountain, and make an ark of wood. 
<a id="10-2"></a> <b>2</b> And I will write on the tablets the words that were on the first tablets, which you broke; and you are to place them in the ark.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="10-3"></a> <b>3</b> So I made an ark of acacia wood, chiseled out two stone tablets like the originals, and went up the mountain with the two tablets in my hands. 
<a id="10-4"></a> <b>4</b> And the LORD wrote on the tablets what had been written previously, the Ten Commandments that He had spoken to you on the mountain out of the fire on the day of the assembly. The LORD gave them to me, 
<a id="10-5"></a> <b>5</b> and I went back down the mountain and placed the tablets in the ark I had made, as the LORD had commanded me; and there they have remained.
</p>

<p>
<a id="10-6"></a> <b>6</b> The Israelites traveled from Beeroth Bene-jaakan to Moserah, where Aaron died and was buried, and Eleazar his son succeeded him as priest. 
<a id="10-7"></a> <b>7</b> From there they traveled to Gudgodah, and from Gudgodah to Jotbathah, a land with streams of water.
</p>

<p>
<a id="10-8"></a> <b>8</b> At that time the LORD set apart the tribe of Levi to carry the ark of the covenant of the LORD, to stand before the LORD to serve Him, and to pronounce blessings in His name, as they do to this day. 
<a id="10-9"></a> <b>9</b> That is why Levi has no portion or inheritance among his brothers; the LORD is his inheritance, as the LORD your God promised him.

<p>
<a id="10-10"></a> <b>10</b> I stayed on the mountain forty days and forty nights, like the first time, and that time the LORD again listened to me and agreed not to destroy you.
</p>

<p>
<a id="10-11"></a> <b>11</b> Then the LORD said to me, “Get up. Continue your journey ahead of the people, that they may enter and possess the land that I swore to their fathers to give them.”

<p>
<a id="20-5"></a> <b>5</b> Furthermore, the officers are to address the army, saying, “Has any man built a new house and not dedicated it? Let him return home, or he may die in battle and another man dedicate it. 
<a id="20-6"></a> <b>6</b> Has any man planted a vineyard and not begun to enjoy its fruit? Let him return home, or he may die in battle and another man enjoy its fruit.

<a id="20-12"></a> <b>12</b> But if they refuse to make peace with you and wage war against you, lay siege to that city. 
<a id="20-13"></a> <b>13</b> When the LORD your God has delivered it into your hand, you must put every male to the sword. 
<a id="20-14"></a> <b>14</b> But the women, children, livestock, and whatever else is in the city&#x2014;all its spoil&#x2014;you may take as plunder, and you shall use the spoil of your enemies that the LORD your God gives you.

</p>

<p>
<a id="20-19"></a> <b>19</b> When you lay siege to a city for an extended time while fighting against it to capture it, you must not destroy its trees by putting an axe to them, because you can eat their fruit.

</p>

<p>
<a id="22-15"></a> <b>15</b> Then the young woman&rsquo;s father and mother shall bring the proof of her virginity to the city elders at the gate 
<a id="22-16"></a> <b>16</b> and say to the elders, “I gave my daughter in marriage to this man, but he has come to hate her. 
<a id="22-17"></a> <b>17</b> And now he has accused her of shameful conduct, saying, ‘I discovered that your daughter was not a virgin.&rsquo; But here is the proof of her virginity.” And they shall spread out the cloth before the city elders.

<a id="27-4"></a> <b>4</b> And when you have crossed the Jordan, you are to set up these stones on Mount Ebal, as I am commanding you today, and you are to coat them with plaster.
</p>

<p>
<a id="27-5"></a> <b>5</b> Moreover, you are to build there an altar to the LORD your God, an altar of stones. You must not use any iron tool on them. 
<a id="27-6"></a> <b>6</b> You shall build the altar of the LORD your God with uncut stones and offer upon it burnt offerings to the LORD your God. 
<a id="27-7"></a> <b>7</b> There you are to sacrifice your peace offerings, eating them and rejoicing in the presence of the LORD your God. 
<a id="27-8"></a> <b>8</b> And you shall write distinctly upon these stones all the words of this law.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="27-9"></a> <b>9</b> Then Moses and the Levitical priests spoke to all Israel: “Be silent, O Israel, and listen! This day you have become the people of the LORD your God. 
<a id="27-10"></a> <b>10</b> You shall therefore obey the voice of the LORD your God and follow His commandments and statutes I am giving you today.”

</p>

<p>
<a id="28-30"></a> <b>30</b> You will be pledged in marriage to a woman, but another man will violate her. You will build a house but will not live in it. You will plant a vineyard but will not enjoy its fruit. 
<a id="28-31"></a> <b>31</b> Your ox will be slaughtered before your eyes, but you will not eat any of it. Your donkey will be taken away and not returned to you. Your flock will be given to your enemies, and no one will save you.

</p>

<p>
<a id="28-35"></a> <b>35</b> The LORD will afflict you with painful, incurable boils on your knees and thighs, from the soles of your feet to the top of your head.
</p>

<p>
<a id="28-36"></a> <b>36</b> The LORD will bring you and the king you appoint to a nation neither you nor your fathers have known, and there you will worship other gods&#x2014;gods of wood and stone.

<a id="28-41"></a> <b>41</b> You will father sons and daughters, but they will not remain yours, because they will go into captivity. 
<a id="28-42"></a> <b>42</b> Swarms of locusts will consume all your trees and the produce of your land.
</p>

<p>
<a id="28-43"></a> <b>43</b> The foreigner living among you will rise higher and higher above you, while you sink down lower and lower. 
<a id="28-44"></a> <b>44</b> He will lend to you, but you will not lend to him. He will be the head, and you will be the tail.
</p>

<p>
<a id="28-45"></a> <b>45</b> All these curses will come upon you. They will pursue you and overtake you until you are destroyed, since you did not obey the LORD your God and keep the commandments and statutes He gave you. 
<a id="28-46"></a> <b>46</b> These curses will be a sign and a wonder upon you and your descendants forever.
</p>

<p>
<a id="28-47"></a> <b>47</b> Because you did not serve the LORD your God with joy and gladness of heart in all your abundance, 
<a id="28-48"></a> <b>48</b> you will serve your enemies the LORD will send against you in famine, thirst, nakedness, and destitution. He will place an iron yoke on your neck until He has destroyed you.

<p>
<a id="28-49"></a> <b>49</b> The LORD will bring a nation from afar, from the ends of the earth, to swoop down upon you like an eagle&#x2014;a nation whose language you will not understand, 
<a id="28-50"></a> <b>50</b> a ruthless nation with no respect for the old and no pity for the young. 
<a id="28-51"></a> <b>51</b> They will eat the offspring of your livestock and the produce of your land until you are destroyed. They will leave you no grain or new wine or oil, no calves of your herds or lambs of your flocks, until they have caused you to perish. 
<a id="28-52"></a> <b>52</b> They will besiege all the cities throughout your land, until the high and fortified walls in which you trust have fallen. They will besiege all your cities throughout the land that the LORD your God has given you.
</p>

<p>
<a id="28-53"></a> <b>53</b> Then you will eat the fruit of your womb, the flesh of the sons and daughters whom the LORD your God has given you, in the siege and distress that your enemy will inflict on you.
</p>

<p>
<a id="28-54"></a> <b>54</b> The most gentle and refined man among you will begrudge his brother, the wife he embraces, and the rest of his children who have survived, 
<a id="28-55"></a> <b>55</b> refusing to share with any of them the flesh of his children he will eat because he has nothing left in the siege and distress that your enemy will inflict on you within all your gates.
</p>

<p>
<a id="28-56"></a> <b>56</b> The most gentle and refined woman among you, so gentle and refined she would not venture to set the sole of her foot on the ground, will begrudge the husband she embraces and her son and daughter 
<a id="28-57"></a> <b>57</b> the afterbirth that comes from between her legs and the children she bears, because she will secretly eat them for lack of anything else in the siege and distress that your enemy will inflict on you within your gates.
</p>

<p>
<a id="28-58"></a> <b>58</b> If you are not careful to observe all the words of this law which are written in this book, that you may fear this glorious and awesome name&#x2014;the LORD your God&#x2014; 
<a id="28-59"></a> <b>59</b> He will bring upon you and your descendants extraordinary disasters, severe and lasting plagues, and terrible and chronic sicknesses. 
<a id="28-60"></a> <b>60</b> He will afflict you again with all the diseases you dreaded in Egypt, and they will cling to you.
</p>

<p>
<a id="28-61"></a> <b>61</b> The LORD will also bring upon you every sickness and plague not recorded in this Book of the Law, until you are destroyed. 
<a id="28-62"></a> <b>62</b> You who were as numerous as the stars in the sky will be left few in number, because you would not obey the voice of the LORD your God.
</p>

<p>
<a id="28-63"></a> <b>63</b> Just as it pleased the LORD to make you prosper and multiply, so also it will please Him to annihilate you and destroy you. And you will be uprooted from the land you are entering to possess.
</p>

<p>
<a id="28-64"></a> <b>64</b> Then the LORD will scatter you among all the nations, from one end of the earth to the other, and there you will worship other gods, gods of wood and stone, which neither you nor your fathers have known. 
<a id="28-65"></a> <b>65</b> Among those nations you will find no repose, not even a resting place for the sole of your foot. There the LORD will give you a trembling heart, failing eyes, and a despairing soul.
</p>

<p>
<a id="28-66"></a> <b>66</b> So your life will hang in doubt before you, and you will be afraid night and day, never certain of survival. 
<a id="28-67"></a> <b>67</b> In the morning you will say, ‘If only it were evening!&rsquo; and in the evening you will say, ‘If only it were morning!&rsquo;&#x2014;because of the dread in your hearts of the terrifying sights you will see.
</p>

<p>
<a id="28-68"></a> <b>68</b> The LORD will return you to Egypt in ships by a route that I said you should never see again. There you will sell yourselves to your enemies as male and female slaves, but no one will buy you.”

<a id="29-1"></a> These are the words of the covenant that the LORD commanded Moses to make with the Israelites in the land of Moab, in addition to the covenant He had made with them at Horeb.
</p>

<p>
<a id="29-2"></a> <b>2</b> Moses summoned all Israel and proclaimed to them, “You have seen with your own eyes everything the LORD did in Egypt to Pharaoh, to all his officials, and to all his land. 
<a id="29-3"></a> <b>3</b> You saw with your own eyes the great trials, and those miraculous signs and wonders. 
<a id="29-4"></a> <b>4</b> Yet to this day the LORD has not given you a mind to understand, eyes to see, or ears to hear.
</p>

<p>
<a id="29-5"></a> <b>5</b> For forty years I led you in the wilderness,
</p>

<p>
yet your clothes and sandals did not wear out.
</p>

<p>
<a id="29-6"></a> <b>6</b> You ate no bread and drank no wine or strong drink,
</p>

<p>
so that you might know that I am the LORD your God.
</p>

<p>
<a id="29-7"></a> <b>7</b> When you reached this place, Sihon king of Heshbon and Og king of Bashan came out against us in battle, but we defeated them. 
<a id="29-8"></a> <b>8</b> We took their land and gave it as an inheritance to the Reubenites, the Gadites, and the half-tribe of Manasseh. 
<a id="29-9"></a> <b>9</b> So keep and follow the words of this covenant, that you may prosper in all you do.
</p>

<p>
<a id="29-10"></a> <b>10</b> All of you are standing today before the LORD your God&#x2014;you leaders of tribes, elders, officials, and all the men of Israel, 
<a id="29-11"></a> <b>11</b> your children and wives, and the foreigners in your camps who cut your wood and draw your water&#x2014; 
<a id="29-12"></a> <b>12</b> so that you may enter into the covenant of the LORD your God, which He is making with you today, and into His oath, 
<a id="29-13"></a> <b>13</b> and so that He may establish you today as His people, and He may be your God as He promised you and as He swore to your fathers, to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.
</p>

<p>
<a id="29-14"></a> <b>14</b> I am making this covenant and this oath not only with you, 
<a id="29-15"></a> <b>15</b> but also with those who are standing here with us today in the presence of the LORD our God, as well as with those who are not here today.
</p>

<p>
<a id="29-16"></a> <b>16</b> For you yourselves know how we lived in the land of Egypt and how we passed through the nations on the way here. 
<a id="29-17"></a> <b>17</b> You saw the abominations and idols among them made of wood and stone, of silver and gold.
</p>

<p>
<a id="29-18"></a> <b>18</b> Make sure there is no man or woman, clan or tribe among you today whose heart turns away from the LORD our God to go and worship the gods of those nations. Make sure there is no root among you that bears such poisonous and bitter fruit, 
<a id="29-19"></a> <b>19</b> because when such a person hears the words of this oath, he invokes a blessing on himself, saying, ‘I will have peace, even though I walk in the stubbornness of my own heart.&rsquo;
</p>

<p>
This will bring disaster on the watered land as well as the dry. 
<a id="29-20"></a> <b>20</b> The LORD will never be willing to forgive him. Instead, His anger and jealousy will burn against that man, and every curse written in this book will fall upon him. The LORD will blot out his name from under heaven 
<a id="29-21"></a> <b>21</b> and single him out from all the tribes of Israel for disaster, according to all the curses of the covenant written in this Book of the Law.
</p>

<p>
<a id="29-22"></a> <b>22</b> Then the generation to come&#x2014;your sons who follow you and the foreigner who comes from a distant land&#x2014;will see the plagues of the land and the sicknesses the LORD has inflicted on it. 
<a id="29-23"></a> <b>23</b> All its soil will be a burning waste of sulfur and salt, unsown and unproductive, with no plant growing on it, just like the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah, Admah and Zeboiim, which the LORD overthrew in His fierce anger.
</p>

<p>
<a id="29-24"></a> <b>24</b> So all the nations will ask, ‘Why has the LORD done such a thing to this land? Why this great outburst of anger?&rsquo;
</p>

<p>
<a id="29-25"></a> <b>25</b> And the people will answer, ‘It is because they abandoned the covenant of the LORD, the God of their fathers, which He made with them when He brought them out of the land of Egypt. 
<a id="29-26"></a> <b>26</b> They went and served other gods, and they worshiped gods they had not known&#x2014;gods that the LORD had not given to them. 
<a id="29-27"></a> <b>27</b> Therefore the anger of the LORD burned against this land, and He brought upon it every curse written in this book. 
<a id="29-28"></a> <b>28</b> The LORD uprooted them from their land in His anger, rage, and great wrath, and He cast them into another land, where they are today.&rsquo;
</p>

<p>
<a id="29-29"></a> <b>29</b> The secret things belong to the LORD our God, but the things revealed belong to us and to our children forever, so that we may follow all the words of this law.

</p>

<p>
the possession of the assembly of Jacob.
</p>

<p>
<a id="33-5"></a> <b>5</b> So the LORD became King in Jeshurun
</p>

<p>
when the leaders of the people gathered,
</p>

<p>
when the tribes of Israel came together.
</p>

<p>
<a id="33-6"></a> <b>6</b> Let Reuben live and not die,

<p>
nor his men be few.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="33-7"></a> <b>7</b> And concerning Judah he said:
</p>

<p>
“O LORD, hear the cry of Judah
</p>

<p>
and bring him to his people.

</p>

<p>
and Your Urim to Your godly one,
</p>

<p>
whom You tested at Massah
</p>

<p>
and contested at the waters of Meribah.
</p>

<p>
<a id="33-9"></a> <b>9</b> He said of his father and mother,
</p>

<p>
‘I do not consider them.&rsquo;
</p>

<p>
He disregarded his brothers
</p>

<p>
and did not know his own sons,
</p>

<p>
for he kept Your word

<p>
and maintained Your covenant.
</p>

<p>
<a id="33-10"></a> <b>10</b> He will teach Your ordinances to Jacob
</p>

<p>

<p>
and accept the work of his hands.

<p>
Smash the loins of those who rise against him,

and of his foes so they can rise no more.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="33-12"></a> <b>12</b> Concerning Benjamin he said:

<p>
<a id="33-14"></a> <b>14</b> with the bountiful harvest from the sun

<p>
and the abundant yield of the seasons,

<p>
<a id="33-15"></a> <b>15</b> with the best of the ancient mountains

<p>
and the bounty of the everlasting hills,

<p>
<a id="33-16"></a> <b>16</b> with the choice gifts of the land and everything in it,
</p>

<p>
and with the favor of Him who dwelt in the burning bush.
</p>

<p>
May these rest on the head of Joseph
</p>

<p>
and crown the brow of the prince of his brothers.
</p>

<p>
<a id="33-17"></a> <b>17</b> His majesty is like a firstborn bull,
</p>

<p>
and his horns are like those of a wild ox.
</p>

<p>
With them he will gore the nations,
</p>

<p>
even to the ends of the earth.
</p>

<p>
Such are the myriads of Ephraim,

<p>
and such are the thousands of Manasseh.”

<p>
<a id="33-20"></a> <b>20</b> Concerning Gad he said:
</p>

<p>
“Blessed is he who enlarges
</p>

<p>
the domain of Gad!
</p>

<p>
He lies down like a lion
</p>

<p>
and tears off an arm or a head.
</p>

<p>
<a id="33-21"></a> <b>21</b> He chose the best land for himself,
</p>

<p>
because a ruler&rsquo;s portion was reserved for him there.
</p>

<p>
He came with the leaders of the people;
</p>

<p>
he administered the LORD&rsquo;s justice
</p>

<p>
and His ordinances for Israel.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="33-22"></a> <b>22</b> Concerning Dan he said:

<p>
<a id="33-24"></a> <b>24</b> And concerning Asher he said:
</p>

<p>
“May Asher be the most blessed of sons;
</p>

<p>
may he be the most favored among his brothers

<p>
and dip his foot in oil.
</p>

<p>
<a id="33-25"></a> <b>25</b> May the bolts of your gate be iron and bronze,
</p>

<p>
and may your strength match your days.”

<p>
<a id="33-26"></a> <b>26</b> “There is none like the God of Jeshurun,

<p>
He drives out the enemy before you,
</p>

<p>
giving the command, ‘Destroy him!&rsquo;
</p>

<p>
<a id="33-28"></a> <b>28</b> So Israel dwells securely;
</p>

<p>
the fountain of Jacob lives untroubled
</p>

<p>
in a land of grain and new wine,
</p>

<p>
where even the heavens drip with dew.
</p>

<p>
<a id="33-29"></a> <b>29</b> Blessed are you, O Israel!
</p>

<p>
Who is like you, a people saved by the LORD?
</p>

<p>
He is the shield that protects you,
</p>

<p>
the sword in which you boast.
</p>

<p>
Your enemies will cower before you,
</p>

<p>
and you shall trample their high places.”

<p>
<a id="34-1"></a> Then Moses went up from the plains of Moab to Mount Nebo, to the top of Pisgah, which faces Jericho. And the LORD showed him the whole land&#x2014;from Gilead as far as Dan, 
<a id="34-2"></a> <b>2</b> all of Naphtali, the land of Ephraim and Manasseh, all the land of Judah as far as the Western Sea, 
<a id="34-3"></a> <b>3</b> the Negev, and the region from the Valley of Jericho (the City of Palms) all the way to Zoar.
</p>

<p>
<a id="34-4"></a> <b>4</b> And the LORD said to him, “This is the land that I swore to give Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob when I said, ‘I will give it to your descendants.&rsquo; I have let you see it with your own eyes, but you will not cross into it.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="34-5"></a> <b>5</b> So Moses the servant of the LORD died there in the land of Moab, as the LORD had said. 
<a id="34-6"></a> <b>6</b> And He buried him in a valley in the land of Moab facing Beth-peor, and no one to this day knows the location of his grave.
</p>

<p>
<a id="34-7"></a> <b>7</b> Moses was a hundred and twenty years old when he died, yet his eyes were not weak, and his vitality had not diminished. 
<a id="34-8"></a> <b>8</b> The Israelites grieved for Moses in the plains of Moab thirty days, until the time of weeping and mourning for Moses came to an end.
</p>

<p>
<a id="34-9"></a> <b>9</b> Now Joshua son of Nun was filled with the spirit of wisdom because Moses had laid his hands on him. So the Israelites obeyed him and did as the LORD had commanded Moses. 
<a id="34-10"></a> <b>10</b> Since that time, no prophet has risen in Israel like Moses, whom the LORD knew face to face&#x2014; 
<a id="34-11"></a> <b>11</b> no prophet who did all the signs and wonders that the LORD sent Moses to do in the land of Egypt to Pharaoh and to all his officials and all his land, 
<a id="34-12"></a> <b>12</b> and no prophet who performed all the mighty acts of power and awesome deeds that Moses did in the sight of all Israel.

<p>
<a id="1-1"></a> These are the words of the Teacher, the son of David, king in Jerusalem:
</p>

<p>
<a id="1-2"></a> <b>2</b> “Futility of futilities,”
</p>

<p>
says the Teacher,
</p>

<p>
“futility of futilities!
</p>

<p>
Everything is futile!”
</p>

<p>
<a id="1-3"></a> <b>3</b> What does a man gain from all his labor,
</p>

<p>
at which he toils under the sun?
</p>

<p>
<a id="1-4"></a> <b>4</b> Generations come and generations go,
</p>

<p>
but the earth remains forever.
</p>

<p>
<a id="1-5"></a> <b>5</b> The sun rises and the sun sets;
</p>

<p>
it hurries back to where it rises.
</p>

<p>
<a id="1-6"></a> <b>6</b> The wind blows southward,
</p>

<p>
then turns northward;
</p>

<p>
round and round it swirls,
</p>

<p>
ever returning on its course.
</p>

<p>
<a id="1-7"></a> <b>7</b> All the rivers flow into the sea,
</p>

<p>
yet the sea is never full;
</p>

<p>
to the place from which the streams come,
</p>

<p>
there again they flow.
</p>

<p>
<a id="1-8"></a> <b>8</b> All things are wearisome,
</p>

<p>
more than one can describe;
</p>

<p>
the eye is not satisfied with seeing,
</p>

<p>
nor the ear content with hearing.
</p>

<p>
<a id="1-9"></a> <b>9</b> What has been will be again,
</p>

<p>
and what has been done will be done again;
</p>

<p>
there is nothing new under the sun.
</p>

<p>
<a id="1-10"></a> <b>10</b> Is there a case where one can say,
</p>

<p>
“Look, this is new”?
</p>

<p>
It has already existed
</p>

<p>
in the ages before us.
</p>

<p>
<a id="1-11"></a> <b>11</b> There is no remembrance
</p>

<p>
of those who came before,
</p>

<p>
and those yet to come will not be remembered
</p>

<p>
by those who follow after.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org2284754">
<p>
<a id="1-12"></a> <b>12</b> I, the Teacher, was king over Israel in Jerusalem. 
<a id="1-13"></a> <b>13</b> And I set my mind to seek and explore by wisdom all that is done under heaven. What a heavy burden God has laid upon the sons of men to occupy them!
</p>

<p>
<a id="1-14"></a> <b>14</b> I have seen all the things that are done under the sun, and have found them all to be futile, a pursuit of the wind.
</p>

<p>
<a id="1-15"></a> <b>15</b> What is crooked cannot be straightened,
</p>

<p>
and what is lacking cannot be counted.
</p>

<p>
<a id="1-16"></a> <b>16</b> I said to myself, “Behold, I have grown and increased in wisdom beyond all those before me who were over Jerusalem, and my mind has observed a wealth of wisdom and knowledge.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="1-17"></a> <b>17</b> So I set my mind to know wisdom and madness and folly; I learned that this, too, is a pursuit of the wind.
</p>

<p>
<a id="1-18"></a> <b>18</b> For with much wisdom comes much sorrow,
</p>

<p>
and as knowledge grows, grief increases.

<h3 id="org59dd337">The Futility of Pleasure</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org59dd337">
<p>
<span class="drop">2</span>
</p>

<p>
<a id="2-1"></a> I said to myself, “Come now, I will test you with pleasure; enjoy what is good!”
</p>

<p>
But it proved to be futile.
</p>

<p>
<a id="2-2"></a> <b>2</b> I said of laughter, “It is folly,” and of pleasure, “What does it accomplish?”
</p>

<p>
<a id="2-3"></a> <b>3</b> I sought to cheer my body with wine and to embrace folly&#x2014;my mind still guiding me with wisdom&#x2014;until I could see what was worthwhile for men to do under heaven during the few days of their lives.
</p>

<p>
<a id="2-4"></a> <b>4</b> I expanded my pursuits. I built houses and planted vineyards for myself. 
<a id="2-5"></a> <b>5</b> I made gardens and parks for myself, where I planted all kinds of fruit trees. 
<a id="2-6"></a> <b>6</b> I built reservoirs to water my groves of flourishing trees.
</p>

<p>
<a id="2-7"></a> <b>7</b> I acquired menservants and maidservants, and servants were born in my house. I also owned more herds and flocks than anyone in Jerusalem before me, 
<a id="2-8"></a> <b>8</b> and I accumulated for myself silver and gold and the treasure of kings and provinces. I gathered to myself male and female singers, and the delights of the sons of men&#x2014;many concubines.
</p>

<p>
<a id="2-9"></a> <b>9</b> So I became great and surpassed all in Jerusalem who had preceded me; and my wisdom remained with me. 
<a id="2-10"></a> <b>10</b> Anything my eyes desired, I did not deny myself. I refused my heart no pleasure. For my heart took delight in all my work, and this was the reward for all my labor.
</p>

<p>
<a id="2-11"></a> <b>11</b> Yet when I considered all the works that my hands had accomplished and what I had toiled to achieve, I found everything to be futile, a pursuit of the wind; there was nothing to be gained under the sun.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-org6ff8acf" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org6ff8acf">The Wise and the Foolish</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org6ff8acf">
<p>
<a id="2-12"></a> <b>12</b> Then I turned to consider wisdom and madness and folly; for what more can the king&rsquo;s successor do than what has already been accomplished? 
<a id="2-13"></a> <b>13</b> And I saw that wisdom exceeds folly, just as light exceeds darkness:
</p>

<p>
<a id="2-14"></a> <b>14</b> The wise man has eyes in his head,
</p>

<p>
but the fool walks in darkness.
</p>

<p>
Yet I also came to realize that one fate overcomes them both. 
<a id="2-15"></a> <b>15</b> So I said to myself, “The fate of the fool will also befall me. What then have I gained by being wise?”
</p>

<p>
And I said to myself that this too is futile.
</p>

<p>
<a id="2-16"></a> <b>16</b> For there is no lasting remembrance of the wise, just as with the fool, seeing that both will be forgotten in the days to come. Alas, the wise man will die just like the fool! 
<a id="2-17"></a> <b>17</b> So I hated life, because the work that is done under the sun was grievous to me. For everything is futile and a pursuit of the wind.
</p>

<h3 id="org09410e0">The Futility of Work</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org09410e0">
<p>
<a id="2-18"></a> <b>18</b> I hated all for which I had toiled under the sun, because I must leave it to the man who comes after me. 
<a id="2-19"></a> <b>19</b> And who knows whether that man will be wise or foolish? Yet he will take over all the labor at which I have worked skillfully under the sun. This too is futile.
</p>

<p>
<a id="2-20"></a> <b>20</b> So my heart began to despair over all the labor that I had done under the sun. 
<a id="2-21"></a> <b>21</b> When there is a man who has labored with wisdom, knowledge, and skill, and he must give his portion to a man who has not worked for it, this too is futile and a great evil. 
<a id="2-22"></a> <b>22</b> For what does a man get for all the toil and striving with which he labors under the sun? 
<a id="2-23"></a> <b>23</b> Indeed, all his days are filled with grief, and his task is sorrowful; even at night, his mind does not rest. This too is futile.
</p>

<p>
<a id="2-24"></a> <b>24</b> Nothing is better for a man than to eat and drink and enjoy his work. I have also seen that this is from the hand of God. 
<a id="2-25"></a> <b>25</b> For apart from Him, who can eat and who can find enjoyment? 
<a id="2-26"></a> <b>26</b> To the man who is pleasing in His sight, He gives wisdom and knowledge and joy, but to the sinner He assigns the task of gathering and accumulating that which he will hand over to one who pleases God. This too is futile and a pursuit of the wind.

<p>

<p>
<a id="4-1"></a> Again I looked, and I considered all the oppression taking place under the sun. I saw the tears of the oppressed, and they had no comforter; the power lay in the hands of their oppressors, and there was no comforter. 
<a id="4-2"></a> <b>2</b> So I admired the dead, who had already died, above the living, who are still alive. 
<a id="4-3"></a> <b>3</b> But better than both is he who has not yet existed, who has not seen the evil that is done under the sun.
</p>

<p>
<a id="4-4"></a> <b>4</b> I saw that all labor and success spring from a man&rsquo;s envy of his neighbor. This too is futile and a pursuit of the wind.

than two handfuls with toil and pursuit of the wind.

<p>
<a id="4-7"></a> <b>7</b> Again, I saw futility under the sun. 
<a id="4-8"></a> <b>8</b> There is a man all alone, without even a son or brother. And though there is no end to his labor, his eyes are still not content with his wealth: “For whom do I toil and bereave my soul of enjoyment?” This too is futile&#x2014;a miserable task.
</p>

<p>
<a id="4-9"></a> <b>9</b> Two are better than one, because they have a good return for their labor. 
<a id="4-10"></a> <b>10</b> For if one falls down, his companion can lift him up; but pity the one who falls without another to help him up! 
<a id="4-11"></a> <b>11</b> Again, if two lie down together, they will keep warm; but how can one keep warm alone? 
<a id="4-12"></a> <b>12</b> And though one may be overpowered, two can resist. Moreover, a cord of three strands is not quickly broken.

</p>

<p>
<a id="7-1"></a> A good name is better than fine perfume,
</p>

<p>
and one&rsquo;s day of death is better than his day of birth.
</p>

<p>
<a id="7-2"></a> <b>2</b> It is better to enter a house of mourning
</p>

<p>
than a house of feasting,
</p>

<p>
since death is the end of every man,
</p>

<p>
and the living should take this to heart.
</p>

<p>
<a id="7-3"></a> <b>3</b> Sorrow is better than laughter,
</p>

<p>
for a sad countenance is good for the heart.
</p>

<p>
<a id="7-4"></a> <b>4</b> The heart of the wise is in the house of mourning,
</p>

<p>
but the heart of fools is in the house of pleasure.
</p>

<p>
<a id="7-5"></a> <b>5</b> It is better to heed a wise man&rsquo;s rebuke
</p>

<p>
than to listen to the song of fools.
</p>

<p>
<a id="7-6"></a> <b>6</b> For like the crackling of thorns under the pot,
</p>

<p>
so is the laughter of the fool. This too is futile.
</p>

<p>
<a id="7-7"></a> <b>7</b> Surely extortion turns a wise man into a fool,
</p>

<p>
and a bribe corrupts the heart.
</p>

<p>
<a id="7-8"></a> <b>8</b> The end of a matter is better than the beginning,
</p>

<p>
and a patient spirit is better than a proud one.
</p>

<p>
<a id="7-9"></a> <b>9</b> Do not be quickly provoked in your spirit,
</p>

<p>
for anger settles in the lap of a fool.
</p>

<p>
<a id="7-10"></a> <b>10</b> Do not say, “Why were the old days better than these?”
</p>

<p>
For it is unwise of you to ask about this.
</p>

<p>
<a id="7-11"></a> <b>11</b> Wisdom, like an inheritance, is good,
</p>

<p>
and it benefits those who see the sun.
</p>

<p>
<a id="7-12"></a> <b>12</b> For wisdom, like money, is a shelter,
</p>

<p>
and the advantage of knowledge
</p>

<p>
is that wisdom preserves the life of its owner.
</p>

<p>
<a id="7-13"></a> <b>13</b> Consider the work of God:
</p>

<p>
Who can straighten what He has bent?
</p>

<p>
<a id="7-14"></a> <b>14</b> In the day of prosperity, be joyful,
</p>

<p>
but in the day of adversity, consider this:
</p>

<p>
God has made one of these along with the other,
</p>

<p>
so that a man cannot discover
</p>

<p>
anything that will come after him.

<p>
<a id="7-15"></a> <b>15</b> In my futile life I have seen both of these:
</p>

<p>
A righteous man perishing in his righteousness,
</p>

<p>
and a wicked man living long in his wickedness.
</p>

<p>
<a id="7-16"></a> <b>16</b> Do not be overly righteous, and do not make yourself too wise. Why should you destroy yourself? 
<a id="7-17"></a> <b>17</b> Do not be excessively wicked, and do not be a fool. Why should you die before your time? 
<a id="7-18"></a> <b>18</b> It is good to grasp the one and not let the other slip from your hand. For he who fears God will follow both warnings.
</p>

<p>
<a id="7-19"></a> <b>19</b> Wisdom makes the wise man
</p>

<p>
stronger than ten rulers in a city.
</p>

<p>
<a id="7-20"></a> <b>20</b> Surely there is no righteous man on earth
</p>

<p>
who does good and never sins.
</p>

<p>
<a id="7-21"></a> <b>21</b> Do not pay attention to every word that is spoken, or you may hear your servant cursing you. 
<a id="7-22"></a> <b>22</b> For you know in your heart that many times you yourself have cursed others.
</p>

<p>
<a id="7-23"></a> <b>23</b> All this I tested by wisdom, saying, “I resolve to be wise.” But it was beyond me. 
<a id="7-24"></a> <b>24</b> What exists is out of reach and very deep. Who can fathom it?
</p>

<p>
<a id="7-25"></a> <b>25</b> I directed my mind to understand, to explore, to search out wisdom and explanations, and to understand the stupidity of wickedness and the folly of madness. 
<a id="7-26"></a> <b>26</b> And I find more bitter than death the woman who is a snare, whose heart is a net, and whose hands are chains. The man who pleases God escapes her, but the sinner is ensnared.
</p>

<p>
<a id="7-27"></a> <b>27</b> “Behold,” says the Teacher, “I have discovered this by adding one thing to another to find an explanation. 
<a id="7-28"></a> <b>28</b> While my soul was still searching but not finding, among a thousand I have found one upright man, but among all these I have not found one such woman. 
<a id="7-29"></a> <b>29</b> Only this have I found: I have discovered that God made men upright, but they have sought out many schemes.”

<p>
<a id="8-2"></a> <b>2</b> Keep the king&rsquo;s command, I say, because of your oath before God. 
<a id="8-3"></a> <b>3</b> Do not hasten to leave his presence, and do not persist in a bad cause, for he will do whatever he pleases.

</p>

<p>
<a id="8-5"></a> <b>5</b> Whoever keeps his command will come to no harm, and a wise heart knows the right time and procedure. 
<a id="8-6"></a> <b>6</b> For there is a right time and procedure to every purpose, though a man&rsquo;s misery weighs heavily upon him. 
<a id="8-7"></a> <b>7</b> Since no one knows what will happen, who can tell him what is to come?
</p>

<p>
<a id="8-8"></a> <b>8</b> As no man has power over the wind to contain it, so no one has authority over his day of death. As no one can be discharged in wartime, so wickedness will not release those who practice it. 
<a id="8-9"></a> <b>9</b> All this I have seen, applying my mind to every deed that is done under the sun; there is a time when one man lords it over another to his own detriment.

<a id="8-11"></a> <b>11</b> When the sentence for a crime is not speedily executed, the hearts of men become fully set on doing evil.
</p>

<p>
<a id="8-12"></a> <b>12</b> Although a sinner does evil a hundred times and still lives long, yet I also know that it will go well with those who fear God, who are reverent in His presence.

</p>

<p>
<a id="8-15"></a> <b>15</b> So I commended the enjoyment of life, because there is nothing better for a man under the sun than to eat and drink and be merry. For this joy will accompany him in his labor during the days of his life that God gives him under the sun.
</p>

<p>
<a id="8-16"></a> <b>16</b> When I applied my mind to know wisdom and to observe the task that one performs on the earth&#x2014;though his eyes do not see sleep in the day or even in the night&#x2014; 
<a id="8-17"></a> <b>17</b> I saw every work of God, and that a man is unable to comprehend the work that is done under the sun. Despite his efforts to search it out, he cannot find its meaning; even if the wise man claims to know, he is unable to comprehend.

</p>

<p>
<a id="9-2"></a> <b>2</b> It is the same for all: There is a common fate for the righteous and the wicked, for the good and the bad, for the clean and the unclean, for the one who sacrifices and the one who does not. As it is for the good, so it is for the sinner; as it is for the one who makes a vow, so it is for the one who refuses to take a vow.

<p>
<a id="9-3"></a> <b>3</b> This is an evil in everything that is done under the sun: There is one fate for everyone. Furthermore, the hearts of men are full of evil and madness while they are alive, and afterward they join the dead.

<p>
<a id="9-4"></a> <b>4</b> There is hope, however, for anyone who is among the living; for even a live dog is better than a dead lion.

<a id="9-11"></a> <b>11</b> I saw something else under the sun: The race is not to the swift, nor the battle to the strong; neither is the bread to the wise, nor the wealth to the intelligent, nor the favor to the skillful. For time and chance happen to all.

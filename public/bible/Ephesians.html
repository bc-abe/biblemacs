<a id="1-3"></a> <b>3</b> Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us in Christ with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly realms. 
<a id="1-4"></a> <b>4</b> For He chose us in Him before the foundation of the world to be holy and blameless in His presence. In love 
<a id="1-5"></a> <b>5</b> He predestined us for adoption as His sons through Jesus Christ, according to the good pleasure of His will,

<p>
<a id="1-7"></a> <b>7</b> In Him we have redemption through His blood, the forgiveness of our trespasses, according to the riches of His grace 
<a id="1-8"></a> <b>8</b> that He lavished on us with all wisdom and understanding. 
<a id="1-9"></a> <b>9</b> And He has made known to us the mystery of His will according to His good pleasure, which He purposed in Christ 
<a id="1-10"></a> <b>10</b> as a plan for the fullness of time, to bring all things in heaven and on earth together in Christ.
</p>

<p>
<a id="1-11"></a> <b>11</b> In Him we were also chosen as God&rsquo;s own, having been predestined according to the plan of Him who works out everything by the counsel of His will, 
<a id="1-12"></a> <b>12</b> in order that we, who were the first to hope in Christ, would be for the praise of His glory.
</p>

<p>

<p>

<p>
<a id="3-1"></a> For this reason I, Paul, the prisoner of Christ Jesus for the sake of you Gentiles&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
<a id="3-2"></a> <b>2</b> Surely you have heard about the stewardship of God&rsquo;s grace that was given to me for you, 
<a id="3-3"></a> <b>3</b> that is, the mystery made known to me by revelation, as I have already written briefly. 
<a id="3-4"></a> <b>4</b> In reading this, then, you will be able to understand my insight into the mystery of Christ, 
<a id="3-5"></a> <b>5</b> which was not made known to men in other generations as it has now been revealed by the Spirit to God&rsquo;s holy apostles and prophets. 
<a id="3-6"></a> <b>6</b> This mystery is that through the gospel the Gentiles are fellow heirs, fellow members of the body, and fellow partakers of the promise in Christ Jesus.
</p>

<p>
<a id="3-7"></a> <b>7</b> I became a servant of this gospel by the gift of God&rsquo;s grace, given me through the working of His power. 
<a id="3-8"></a> <b>8</b> Though I am less than the least of all the saints, this grace was given me: to preach to the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ, 
<a id="3-9"></a> <b>9</b> and to illuminate for everyone the stewardship of this mystery, which for ages past was kept hidden in God, who created all things. 
<a id="3-10"></a> <b>10</b> His purpose was that now, through the church, the manifold wisdom of God should be made known to the rulers and authorities in the heavenly realms, 
<a id="3-11"></a> <b>11</b> according to the eternal purpose that He accomplished in Christ Jesus our Lord.
</p>

<p>
<a id="3-12"></a> <b>12</b> In Him and through faith in Him we may enter God&rsquo;s presence with boldness and confidence. 
<a id="3-13"></a> <b>13</b> So I ask you not to be discouraged because of my sufferings for you, which are your glory.

14&#x2026; for this reason I bow my knees before the Father, 
<a id="3-15"></a> <b>15</b> from whom every family in heaven and on earth derives its name. 
<a id="3-16"></a> <b>16</b> I ask that out of the riches of His glory He may strengthen you with power through His Spirit in your inner being, 
<a id="3-17"></a> <b>17</b> so that Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith. Then you, being rooted and grounded in love, 
<a id="3-18"></a> <b>18</b> will have power, together with all the saints, to comprehend the length and width and height and depth 
<a id="3-19"></a> <b>19</b> of the love of Christ, and to know this love that surpasses knowledge, that you may be filled with all the fullness of God.
</p>

<p>
<a id="3-20"></a> <b>20</b> Now to Him who is able to do immeasurably than all we ask or imagine, according to His power that is at work within us,

<p>
<a id="4-1"></a> As a prisoner in the Lord, then, I urge you to walk in a manner worthy of the calling you have received: 
<a id="4-2"></a> <b>2</b> with all humility and gentleness, with patience, bearing with one another in love, 
<a id="4-3"></a> <b>3</b> and with diligence to preserve the unity of the Spirit through the bond of peace.
</p>

<p>
<a id="4-4"></a> <b>4</b> There is one body and one Spirit, just as you were called to one hope when you were called; 
<a id="4-5"></a> <b>5</b> one Lord, one faith, one baptism; 
<a id="4-6"></a> <b>6</b> one God and Father of all, who is over all and through all and in all.
</p>

<p>
<a id="4-7"></a> <b>7</b> Now to each one of us grace has been given according to the measure of the gift of Christ. 
<a id="4-8"></a> <b>8</b> This is why it says:
</p>

<p>
“When He ascended on high,
</p>

<p>
He led captives away,
</p>

<p>
and gave gifts to men.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="4-9"></a> <b>9</b> What does “He ascended” mean, except that He also descended to the lower parts of the earth? 
<a id="4-10"></a> <b>10</b> He who descended is the very One who ascended above all the heavens, in order to fill all things.
</p>

<p>
<a id="4-11"></a> <b>11</b> And it was He who gave some to be apostles, some to be prophets, some to be evangelists, and some to be pastors and teachers, 
<a id="4-12"></a> <b>12</b> to equip the saints for works of ministry and to build up the body of Christ, 
<a id="4-13"></a> <b>13</b> until we all reach unity in the faith and in the knowledge of the Son of God, as we mature to the full measure of the stature of Christ.
</p>

<p>
<a id="4-14"></a> <b>14</b> Then we will no longer be infants, tossed about by the waves and carried around by every wind of teaching and by the clever cunning of men in their deceitful scheming. 
<a id="4-15"></a> <b>15</b> Instead, speaking the truth in love, we will in all things grow up into Christ Himself, who is the head. 
<a id="4-16"></a> <b>16</b> From Him the whole body, fitted and held together by every supporting ligament, grows and builds itself up in love through the work of each individual part.

<a id="4-17"></a> <b>17</b> So I tell you this, and insist on it in the Lord, that you must no longer walk as the Gentiles do, in the futility of their thinking. 
<a id="4-18"></a> <b>18</b> They are darkened in their understanding and alienated from the life of God because of the ignorance that is in them due to the hardness of their hearts. 
<a id="4-19"></a> <b>19</b> Having lost all sense of shame, they have given themselves over to sensuality for the practice of every kind of impurity, with a craving for more.
</p>

<p>
<a id="4-20"></a> <b>20</b> But this is not the way you came to know Christ. 
<a id="4-21"></a> <b>21</b> Surely you heard of Him and were taught in Him&#x2014;in keeping with the truth that is in Jesus&#x2014; 
<a id="4-22"></a> <b>22</b> to put off your former way of life, your old self, which is being corrupted by its deceitful desires; 
<a id="4-23"></a> <b>23</b> to be renewed in the spirit of your minds; 
<a id="4-24"></a> <b>24</b> and to put on the new self, created to be like God in true righteousness and holiness.

<p>
<a id="4-25"></a> <b>25</b> Therefore each of you must put off falsehood and speak truthfully to his neighbor, for we are all members of one another.

<p>
<a id="4-30"></a> <b>30</b> And do not grieve the Holy Spirit of God, in whom you were sealed for the day of redemption.

<p>
<a id="4-31"></a> <b>31</b> Get rid of all bitterness, rage and anger, outcry and slander, along with every form of malice.

<a id="6-5"></a> <b>5</b> Slaves, obey your earthly masters with respect and fear and sincerity of heart, just as you would obey Christ. 
<a id="6-6"></a> <b>6</b> And do this not only to please them while they are watching, but as servants of Christ, doing the will of God from your heart. 
<a id="6-7"></a> <b>7</b> Serve with good will, as to the Lord and not to men, 
<a id="6-8"></a> <b>8</b> because you know that the Lord will reward each one for whatever good he does, whether he is slave or free.
</p>

<p>
<a id="6-9"></a> <b>9</b> And masters, do the same for your slaves. Give up your use of threats, because you know that He who is both their Master and yours is in heaven, and there is no favoritism with Him.

<a id="6-10"></a> <b>10</b> Finally, be strong in the Lord and in His mighty power. 
<a id="6-11"></a> <b>11</b> Put on the full armor of God, so that you can make your stand against the devil&rsquo;s schemes. 
<a id="6-12"></a> <b>12</b> For our struggle is not against flesh and blood, but against the rulers, against the authorities, against the powers of this world&rsquo;s darkness, and against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly realms.
</p>

<p>
<a id="6-13"></a> <b>13</b> Therefore take up the full armor of God, so that when the day of evil comes, you will be able to stand your ground, and having done everything, to stand. 
<a id="6-14"></a> <b>14</b> Stand firm then, with the belt of truth buckled around your waist, with the breastplate of righteousness arrayed, 
<a id="6-15"></a> <b>15</b> and with your feet fitted with the readiness of the gospel of peace. 
<a id="6-16"></a> <b>16</b> In addition to all this, take up the shield of faith, with which you can extinguish all the flaming arrows of the evil one. 
<a id="6-17"></a> <b>17</b> And take the helmet of salvation and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God.
</p>

<p>
<a id="6-18"></a> <b>18</b> Pray in the Spirit at all times, with every kind of prayer and petition. To this end, stay alert with all perseverance in your prayers for all the saints. 
<a id="6-19"></a> <b>19</b> Pray also for me, that whenever I open my mouth, words may be given me so that I will boldly make known the mystery of the gospel, 
<a id="6-20"></a> <b>20</b> for which I am an ambassador in chains. Pray that I may proclaim it fearlessly, as I should.

<p>
<a id="1-6"></a> <b>6</b> Now Joseph and all his brothers and all that generation died,

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org8885ced">
<p>
<a id="1-8"></a> <b>8</b> Then a new king, who did not know Joseph, came to power in Egypt.
<a id="1-9"></a> <b>9</b> “Look,” he said to his people, “the Israelites have become too numerous and too powerful for us. 
<a id="1-10"></a> <b>10</b> Come, let us deal shrewdly with them, or they will increase even more; and if a war breaks out, they may join our enemies, fight against us, and leave the country.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="1-11"></a> <b>11</b> So the Egyptians appointed taskmasters over the Israelites to oppress them with forced labor. As a result, they built Pithom and Rameses as store cities for Pharaoh. 
<a id="1-12"></a> <b>12</b> But the more they were oppressed, the more they multiplied and flourished; so the Egyptians came to dread the Israelites.
</p>

<p>
<a id="1-13"></a> <b>13</b> They worked the Israelites ruthlessly 
<a id="1-14"></a> <b>14</b> and made their lives bitter with hard labor in brick and mortar, and with all kinds of work in the fields. Every service they imposed was harsh.
</p>

<p>
<a id="1-15"></a> <b>15</b> Then the king of Egypt said to the Hebrew midwives, whose names were Shiphrah and Puah,
<a id="1-16"></a> <b>16</b> “When you help the Hebrew women give birth, observe them on the birthstools. If the child is a son, kill him; but if it is a daughter, let her live.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="1-17"></a> <b>17</b> The midwives, however, feared God and did not do as the king of Egypt had instructed; they let the boys live. 
<a id="1-18"></a> <b>18</b> So the king of Egypt summoned the midwives and asked them, “Why have you done this? Why have you let the boys live?”
</p>

<p>
<a id="1-19"></a> <b>19</b> The midwives answered Pharaoh, “The Hebrew women are not like the Egyptian women, for they are vigorous and give birth before a midwife arrives.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="1-20"></a> <b>20</b> So God was good to the midwives, and the people multiplied and became even more numerous. 
<a id="1-21"></a> <b>21</b> And because the midwives feared God, He gave them families of their own.
</p>

<p>
<a id="1-22"></a> <b>22</b> Then Pharaoh commanded all his people: “Every son born to the Hebrews you must throw into the Nile, but every daughter you may allow to live.”

<p>
<a id="2-1"></a> Now a man of the house of Levi married a daughter of Levi, 
<a id="2-2"></a> <b>2</b> and she conceived and gave birth to a son. When she saw that he was a beautiful child, she hid him for three months.
</p>

<p>
<a id="2-3"></a> <b>3</b> But when she could no longer hide him, she got him a papyrus basket and coated it with tar and pitch. Then she placed the child in the basket and set it among the reeds along the bank of the Nile. 
<a id="2-4"></a> <b>4</b> And his sister stood at a distance to see what would happen to him.
</p>

<p>
<a id="2-5"></a> <b>5</b> Soon the daughter of Pharaoh went down to bathe in the Nile, and her attendants were walking along the riverbank. And when she saw the basket among the reeds, she sent her maidservant to retrieve it. 
<a id="2-6"></a> <b>6</b> When she opened it, she saw the child, and behold, the little boy was crying. So she had compassion on him and said, “This is one of the Hebrew children.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="2-7"></a> <b>7</b> Then his sister said to Pharaoh&rsquo;s daughter, “Shall I go and call one of the Hebrew women to nurse the child for you?”
<a id="2-8"></a> <b>8</b> “Go ahead,” Pharaoh&rsquo;s daughter told her. And the girl went and called the boy&rsquo;s mother.
</p>

<p>
<a id="2-9"></a> <b>9</b> Pharaoh&rsquo;s daughter said to her, “Take this child and nurse him for me, and I will pay your wages.” So the woman took the boy and nursed him.
</p>

<p>
<a id="2-10"></a> <b>10</b> When the child had grown older, she brought him to Pharaoh&rsquo;s daughter, and he became her son. She named him Moses and explained, “I drew him out of the water.”

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org60ff10b">
<p>
<a id="2-11"></a> <b>11</b> One day, after Moses had grown up, he went out to his own people and observed their hard labor. He saw an Egyptian beating a Hebrew, one of his own people. 
<a id="2-12"></a> <b>12</b> After looking this way and that and seeing no one, he struck down the Egyptian and hid his body in the sand.
</p>

<p>
<a id="2-13"></a> <b>13</b> The next day Moses went out and saw two Hebrews fighting. He asked the one in the wrong, “Why are you attacking your companion?”
</p>

<p>
<a id="2-14"></a> <b>14</b> But the man replied, “Who made you ruler and judge over us? Are you planning to kill me as you killed the Egyptian?”
Then Moses was afraid and thought, “This thing I have done has surely become known.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="2-15"></a> <b>15</b> When Pharaoh heard about this matter, he sought to kill Moses. But Moses fled from Pharaoh and settled in the land of Midian, where he sat down beside a well.
</p>

<p>
<a id="2-16"></a> <b>16</b> Now the priest of Midian had seven daughters, and they came to draw water and fill the troughs to water their father&rsquo;s flock. 
<a id="2-17"></a> <b>17</b> And when some shepherds came along and drove them away, Moses rose up to help them and watered their flock.
</p>

<p>
<a id="2-18"></a> <b>18</b> When the daughters returned to their father Reuel, he asked them, “Why have you returned so early today?”
<a id="2-19"></a> <b>19</b> “An Egyptian rescued us from the shepherds,” they replied. “He even drew water for us and watered the flock.”
<a id="2-20"></a> <b>20</b> “So where is he?” their father asked. “Why did you leave the man behind? Invite him to have something to eat.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="2-21"></a> <b>21</b> Moses agreed to stay with the man, and he gave his daughter Zipporah to Moses in marriage. 
<a id="2-22"></a> <b>22</b> And she gave birth to a son, and Moses named him Gershom, saying, “I have become a foreigner in a foreign land.”

<p>
<a id="2-24"></a> <b>24</b> So God heard their groaning, and He remembered His covenant with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.

<p>
<a id="3-1"></a> Meanwhile, Moses was shepherding the flock of his father-in-law Jethro, the priest of Midian. He led the flock to the far side of the wilderness and came to Horeb, the mountain of God. 
<a id="3-2"></a> <b>2</b> There the angel of the LORD appeared to him in a blazing fire from within a bush. Moses saw the bush ablaze with fire, but it was not consumed. 
<a id="3-3"></a> <b>3</b> So Moses thought, “I must go over and see this marvelous sight. Why is the bush not burning up?”
</p>

<p>
<a id="3-4"></a> <b>4</b> When the LORD saw that he had gone over to look, God called out to him from within the bush, “Moses, Moses!”
“Here I am,” he answered.
<a id="3-5"></a> <b>5</b> “Do not come any closer,” God said. “Take off your sandals, for the place where you are standing is holy ground.”

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org927a4b2">
<p>
<a id="3-7"></a> <b>7</b> The LORD said, “I have indeed seen the affliction of My people in Egypt. I have heard them crying out because of their oppressors, and I am aware of their sufferings. 
<a id="3-8"></a> <b>8</b> I have come down to rescue them from the hand of the Egyptians and to bring them up out of that land to a good and spacious land, a land flowing with milk and honey&#x2014;the home of the Canaanites, Hittites, Amorites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites.
</p>

<p>
<a id="3-9"></a> <b>9</b> And now the cry of the Israelites has reached Me, and I have seen how severely the Egyptians are oppressing them. 
<a id="3-10"></a> <b>10</b> Therefore, go! I am sending you to Pharaoh to bring My people the Israelites out of Egypt.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="3-11"></a> <b>11</b> But Moses asked God, “Who am I, that I should go to Pharaoh and bring the Israelites out of Egypt?”
<a id="3-12"></a> <b>12</b> “I will surely be with you,” God said, “and this will be the sign to you that I have sent you: When you have brought the people out of Egypt, all of you will worship God on this mountain.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="3-13"></a> <b>13</b> Then Moses asked God, “Suppose I go to the Israelites and say to them, ‘The God of your fathers has sent me to you,&rsquo; and they ask me, ‘What is His name?&rsquo; What should I tell them?”
</p>

<p>
<a id="3-14"></a> <b>14</b> God said to Moses, “I AM WHO I AM. This is what you are to say to the Israelites: ‘I AM has sent me to you.&rsquo; ”
</p>

<p>
<a id="3-15"></a> <b>15</b> God also told Moses, “Say to the Israelites, ‘The LORD, the God of your fathers&#x2014;the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob&#x2014;has sent me to you.&rsquo; This is My name forever, and this is how I am to be remembered in every generation.
</p>

<p>
<a id="3-16"></a> <b>16</b> Go, assemble the elders of Israel and say to them, ‘The LORD, the God of your fathers&#x2014;the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob&#x2014;has appeared to me and said: I have surely attended to you and have seen what has been done to you in Egypt. 
<a id="3-17"></a> <b>17</b> And I have promised to bring you up out of your affliction in Egypt, into the land of the Canaanites, Hittites, Amorites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites&#x2014;a land flowing with milk and honey.&rsquo;
</p>

<p>
<a id="3-18"></a> <b>18</b> The elders of Israel will listen to what you say, and you must go with them to the king of Egypt and tell him, ‘The LORD, the God of the Hebrews, has met with us.

</p>

<p>
<a id="3-19"></a> <b>19</b> But I know that the king of Egypt will not allow you to go unless a mighty hand compels him. 
<a id="3-20"></a> <b>20</b> So I will stretch out My hand and strike the Egyptians with all the wonders I will perform among them. And after that, he will release you.
</p>

<p>
<a id="3-21"></a> <b>21</b> And I will grant this people such favor in the sight of the Egyptians that when you leave, you will not go away empty-handed. 
<a id="3-22"></a> <b>22</b> Every woman shall ask her neighbor and any woman staying in her house for silver and gold jewelry and clothing, and you will put them on your sons and daughters. So you will plunder the Egyptians.”

“A staff,” he replied.
<a id="4-3"></a> <b>3</b> “Throw it on the ground,” said the LORD. So Moses threw it on the ground, and it became a snake, and he ran from it.
<a id="4-4"></a> <b>4</b> “Stretch out your hand and grab it by the tail,” the LORD said to Moses, who reached out his hand and caught the snake, and it turned back into a staff in his hand.
<a id="4-5"></a> <b>5</b> “This is so that they may believe that the LORD, the God of their fathers&#x2014;the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob&#x2014;has appeared to you.”

<a id="4-7"></a> <b>7</b> “Put your hand back inside your cloak,” said the LORD.
So Moses put his hand back inside his cloak, and when he took it out, it was restored, like the rest of his skin.

<p>
<a id="4-8"></a> <b>8</b> And the LORD said, “If they refuse to believe you or heed the witness of the first sign, they may believe that of the second.

“Go in peace,” Jethro replied.

<p>
<a id="4-21"></a> <b>21</b> The LORD instructed Moses, “When you go back to Egypt, see that you perform before Pharaoh all the wonders that I have put within your power. But I will harden his heart so that he will not let the people go.

<a id="4-22"></a> <b>22</b> Then tell Pharaoh that this is what the LORD says: ‘Israel is My firstborn son,

<a id="5-12"></a> <b>12</b> So the people scattered all over the land of Egypt to gather stubble for straw. 
<a id="5-13"></a> <b>13</b> The taskmasters kept pressing them, saying, “Fulfill your quota each day, just as you did when straw was provided.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="5-14"></a> <b>14</b> Then the Israelite foremen, whom Pharaoh&rsquo;s taskmasters had set over the people, were beaten and asked, “Why have you not fulfilled your quota of bricks yesterday or today, as you did before?”

<a id="5-16"></a> <b>16</b> No straw has been given to your servants, yet we are told, ‘Make bricks!&rsquo; Look, your servants are being beaten, but the fault is with your own people.”
<a id="5-17"></a> <b>17</b> “You are slackers!” Pharaoh replied. “Slackers! That is why you keep saying, ‘Let us go and sacrifice to the LORD.&rsquo; 
<a id="5-18"></a> <b>18</b> Now get to work. You will be given no straw, yet you must deliver the full quota of bricks.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="5-19"></a> <b>19</b> The Israelite foremen realized they were in trouble when they were told, “You must not reduce your daily quota of bricks.” 
<a id="5-20"></a> <b>20</b> When they left Pharaoh, they confronted Moses and Aaron, who stood waiting to meet them.
<a id="5-21"></a> <b>21</b> “May the LORD look upon you and judge you,” the foremen said, “for you have made us a stench before Pharaoh and his officials; you have placed in their hand a sword to kill us!”

<p>
<a id="9-27"></a> <b>27</b> Then Pharaoh summoned Moses and Aaron. “This time I have sinned,” he said. “The LORD is righteous, and I and my people are wicked. 
<a id="9-28"></a> <b>28</b> Pray to the LORD, for there has been enough of God&rsquo;s thunder and hail. I will let you go; you do not need to stay any longer.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="9-29"></a> <b>29</b> Moses said to him, “When I have left the city, I will spread out my hands to the LORD. The thunder will cease, and there will be no more hail, so that you may know that the earth is the LORD&rsquo;s. 
<a id="9-30"></a> <b>30</b> But as for you and your officials, I know that you still do not fear the LORD our God.”
31(Now the flax and barley were destroyed, since the barley was ripe and the flax was in bloom; 
<a id="9-32"></a> <b>32</b> but the wheat and spelt were not destroyed, because they are late crops.)
</p>

<p>
<a id="9-33"></a> <b>33</b> Then Moses departed from Pharaoh, went out of the city, and spread out his hands to the LORD. The thunder and hail ceased, and the rain no longer poured down on the land.
</p>

<p>
<a id="9-34"></a> <b>34</b> When Pharaoh saw that the rain and hail and thunder had ceased, he sinned again and hardened his heart&#x2014;he and his officials. 
<a id="9-35"></a> <b>35</b> So Pharaoh&rsquo;s heart was hardened, and he would not let the Israelites go, just as the LORD had said through Moses.

<p>
<a id="10-16"></a> <b>16</b> Pharaoh quickly summoned Moses and Aaron and said, “I have sinned against the LORD your God and against you.

<p>
<a id="10-18"></a> <b>18</b> So Moses left Pharaoh&rsquo;s presence and appealed to the LORD.

<p>
<a id="14-1"></a> Then the LORD said to Moses,
<a id="14-2"></a> <b>2</b> “Tell the Israelites to turn back and encamp before Pi-hahiroth, between Migdol and the sea. You are to encamp by the sea, directly opposite Baal-zephon.
</p>

<p>
<a id="14-3"></a> <b>3</b> For Pharaoh will say of the Israelites, ‘They are wandering the land in confusion; the wilderness has boxed them in.&rsquo; 
<a id="14-4"></a> <b>4</b> And I will harden Pharaoh&rsquo;s heart so that he will pursue them. But I will gain honor by means of Pharaoh and all his army, and the Egyptians will know that I am the LORD.”
So this is what the Israelites did.
</p>

<p>
<a id="14-5"></a> <b>5</b> When the king of Egypt was told that the people had fled, Pharaoh and his officials changed their minds about them and said, “What have we done? We have released Israel from serving us.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="14-6"></a> <b>6</b> So Pharaoh prepared his chariot and took his army with him. 
<a id="14-7"></a> <b>7</b> He took 600 of the best chariots, and all the other chariots of Egypt, with officers over all of them.
</p>

<p>
<a id="14-8"></a> <b>8</b> And the LORD hardened the heart of Pharaoh king of Egypt so that he pursued the Israelites, who were marching out defiantly. 
<a id="14-9"></a> <b>9</b> The Egyptians&#x2014;all Pharaoh&rsquo;s horses and chariots, horsemen and troops&#x2014;pursued the Israelites and overtook them as they camped by the sea near Pi-hahiroth, opposite Baal-zephon.
</p>

<p>
<a id="14-10"></a> <b>10</b> As Pharaoh approached, the Israelites looked up and saw the Egyptians marching after them, and they were terrified and cried out to the LORD. 
<a id="14-11"></a> <b>11</b> They said to Moses, “Was it because there were no graves in Egypt that you brought us into the wilderness to die? What have you done to us by bringing us out of Egypt? 
<a id="14-12"></a> <b>12</b> Did we not say to you in Egypt, ‘Leave us alone so that we may serve the Egyptians&rsquo;? For it would have been better for us to serve the Egyptians than to die in the wilderness.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="14-13"></a> <b>13</b> But Moses told the people, “Do not be afraid. Stand firm and you will see the LORD&rsquo;s salvation, which He will accomplish for you today; for the Egyptians you see today, you will never see again. 
<a id="14-14"></a> <b>14</b> The LORD will fight for you; you need only to be still.”

<a id="14-15"></a> <b>15</b> Then the LORD said to Moses, “Why are you crying out to Me? Tell the Israelites to go forward. 
<a id="14-16"></a> <b>16</b> And as for you, lift up your staff and stretch out your hand over the sea and divide it, so that the Israelites can go through the sea on dry ground. 
<a id="14-17"></a> <b>17</b> And I will harden the hearts of the Egyptians so that they will go in after them. Then I will gain honor by means of Pharaoh and all his army and chariots and horsemen. 
<a id="14-18"></a> <b>18</b> The Egyptians will know that I am the LORD when I am honored through Pharaoh, his chariots, and his horsemen.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="14-19"></a> <b>19</b> And the angel of God, who had gone before the camp of Israel, withdrew and went behind them. The pillar of cloud also moved from before them and stood behind them, 
<a id="14-20"></a> <b>20</b> so that it came between the camps of Egypt and Israel. The cloud was there in the darkness, but it lit up the night. So all night long neither camp went near the other.
</p>

<p>
<a id="14-21"></a> <b>21</b> Then Moses stretched out his hand over the sea, and all that night the LORD drove back the sea with a strong east wind that turned it into dry land. So the waters were divided, 
<a id="14-22"></a> <b>22</b> and the Israelites went through the sea on dry ground, with walls of water on their right and on their left.
</p>

<p>
<a id="14-23"></a> <b>23</b> And the Egyptians chased after them&#x2014;all Pharaoh&rsquo;s horses, chariots, and horsemen&#x2014;and followed them into the sea. 
<a id="14-24"></a> <b>24</b> At morning watch, however, the LORD looked down on the army of the Egyptians from the pillar of fire and cloud, and He threw their camp into confusion. 
<a id="14-25"></a> <b>25</b> He caused their chariot wheels to wobble, so that they had difficulty driving. “Let us flee from the Israelites,” said the Egyptians, “for the LORD is fighting for them against Egypt!”
</p>

<p>
<a id="14-26"></a> <b>26</b> Then the LORD said to Moses, “Stretch out your hand over the sea, so that the waters may flow back over the Egyptians and their chariots and horsemen.” 
<a id="14-27"></a> <b>27</b> So Moses stretched out his hand over the sea, and at daybreak the sea returned to its normal state. As the Egyptians were retreating, the LORD swept them into the sea. 
<a id="14-28"></a> <b>28</b> The waters flowed back and covered the chariots and horsemen&#x2014;the entire army of Pharaoh that had chased the Israelites into the sea. Not one of them survived.
</p>

<p>
<a id="14-29"></a> <b>29</b> But the Israelites had walked through the sea on dry ground, with walls of water on their right and on their left. 
<a id="14-30"></a> <b>30</b> That day the LORD saved Israel from the hand of the Egyptians, and Israel saw the Egyptians dead on the shore. 
<a id="14-31"></a> <b>31</b> When Israel saw the great power that the LORD had exercised over the Egyptians, the people feared the LORD and believed in Him and in His servant Moses.

<a id="15-20"></a> <b>20</b> Then Miriam the prophetess, Aaron&rsquo;s sister, took a tambourine in her hand, and all the women followed her with tambourines and dancing.

<a id="15-24"></a> <b>24</b> So the people grumbled against Moses, saying, “What are we to drink?” 
<a id="15-25"></a> <b>25</b> And Moses cried out to the LORD, and the LORD showed him a log. And when he cast it into the waters, they were sweetened.
There the LORD made for them a statute and an ordinance, and there He tested them,

<p>
<a id="16-1"></a> On the fifteenth day of the second month after they had left the land of Egypt, the whole congregation of Israel set out from Elim and came to the Desert of Sin, which is between Elim and Sinai. 
<a id="16-2"></a> <b>2</b> And there in the desert they all grumbled against Moses and Aaron.
<a id="16-3"></a> <b>3</b> “If only we had died by the LORD&rsquo;s hand in the land of Egypt!” they said. “There we sat by pots of meat and ate our fill of bread, but you have brought us into this desert to starve this whole assembly to death!”
</p>

<p>
<a id="16-4"></a> <b>4</b> Then the LORD said to Moses, “Behold, I will rain down bread from heaven for you. Each day the people are to go out and gather enough for that day. In this way I will test whether or not they will follow My instructions. 
<a id="16-5"></a> <b>5</b> Then on the sixth day, when they prepare what they bring in, it will be twice as much as they gather on the other days.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="16-6"></a> <b>6</b> So Moses and Aaron said to all the Israelites, “This evening you will know that it was the LORD who brought you out of the land of Egypt, 
<a id="16-7"></a> <b>7</b> and in the morning you will see the LORD&rsquo;s glory, because He has heard your grumbling against Him. For who are we that you should grumble against us?”
</p>

<p>
<a id="16-8"></a> <b>8</b> And Moses added, “The LORD will give you meat to eat this evening and bread to fill you in the morning, for He has heard your grumbling against Him. Who are we? Your grumblings are not against us but against the LORD.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="16-9"></a> <b>9</b> Then Moses said to Aaron, “Tell the whole congregation of Israel, ‘Come before the LORD, for He has heard your grumbling.&rsquo; ”
</p>

<p>
<a id="16-10"></a> <b>10</b> And as Aaron was speaking to the whole congregation of Israel, they looked toward the desert, and there in a cloud the glory of the LORD appeared.
</p>

<p>
<a id="16-11"></a> <b>11</b> Then the LORD said to Moses,
<a id="16-12"></a> <b>12</b> “I have heard the grumbling of the Israelites. Tell them, ‘At twilight you will eat meat, and in the morning you will be filled with bread. Then you will know that I am the LORD your God.&rsquo; ”
</p>

<p>
<a id="16-13"></a> <b>13</b> That evening quail came and covered the camp, and in the morning there was a layer of dew around the camp. 
<a id="16-14"></a> <b>14</b> When the layer of dew had evaporated, there were thin flakes on the desert floor, as fine as frost on the ground. 
<a id="16-15"></a> <b>15</b> When the Israelites saw it, they asked one another, “What is it?” For they did not know what it was.
So Moses told them, “It is the bread that the LORD has given you to eat. 
<a id="16-16"></a> <b>16</b> This is what the LORD has commanded: ‘Each one is to gather as much as he needs. You may take an omer for each person in your tent.&rsquo; ”
</p>

<p>
<a id="16-17"></a> <b>17</b> So the Israelites did this. Some gathered more, and some less. 
<a id="16-18"></a> <b>18</b> When they measured it by the omer, he who gathered much had no excess, and he who gathered little had no shortfall. Each one gathered as much as he needed to eat.
</p>

<p>
<a id="16-19"></a> <b>19</b> Then Moses said to them, “No one may keep any of it until morning.” 
<a id="16-20"></a> <b>20</b> But they did not listen to Moses; some people left part of it until morning, and it became infested with maggots and began to smell. So Moses was angry with them.
</p>

<p>
<a id="16-21"></a> <b>21</b> Every morning each one gathered as much as was needed, and when the sun grew hot, it melted away.
The Sabbath Observed (Genesis 2:1&#x2013;3; Hebrews 4:1&#x2013;11)
</p>

<p>
<a id="16-22"></a> <b>22</b> On the sixth day, they gathered twice as much food&#x2014;two omers per person &#x2014;and all the leaders of the congregation came and reported this to Moses. 
<a id="16-23"></a> <b>23</b> He told them, “This is what the LORD has said: ‘Tomorrow is to be a day of complete rest, a holy Sabbath to the LORD. So bake what you want to bake, and boil what you want to boil. Then set aside whatever remains and keep it until morning.&rsquo; ”
</p>

<p>
<a id="16-24"></a> <b>24</b> So they set it aside until morning as Moses had commanded, and it did not smell or contain any maggots.
<a id="16-25"></a> <b>25</b> “Eat it today,” Moses said, “because today is a Sabbath to the LORD. Today you will not find anything in the field. 
<a id="16-26"></a> <b>26</b> For six days you may gather, but on the seventh day, the Sabbath, it will not be there.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="16-27"></a> <b>27</b> Yet on the seventh day some of the people went out to gather, but they did not find anything. 
<a id="16-28"></a> <b>28</b> Then the LORD said to Moses, “How long will you refuse to keep My commandments and instructions? 
<a id="16-29"></a> <b>29</b> Understand that the LORD has given you the Sabbath; that is why on the sixth day He will give you bread for two days. On the seventh day, everyone must stay where he is; no one may leave his place.”

<a id="16-33"></a> <b>33</b> So Moses told Aaron, “Take a jar and fill it with an omer of manna. Then place it before the LORD to be preserved for the generations to come.”

<a id="18-15"></a> <b>15</b> “Because the people come to me to inquire of God,” Moses replied.
<a id="18-16"></a> <b>16</b> “Whenever they have a dispute, it is brought to me to judge between one man and another, and I make known to them the statutes and laws of God.”

<a id="32-1"></a> Now when the people saw that Moses was delayed in coming down from the mountain, they gathered around Aaron and said, “Come, make us gods who will go before us. As for this Moses who brought us up out of the land of Egypt, we do not know what has happened to him!”
</p>

<p>
<a id="32-2"></a> <b>2</b> So Aaron told them, “Take off the gold earrings that are on your wives and sons and daughters, and bring them to me.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="32-3"></a> <b>3</b> Then all the people took off their gold earrings and brought them to Aaron. 
<a id="32-4"></a> <b>4</b> He took the gold from their hands, and with an engraving tool he fashioned it into a molten calf. And they said, “These, O Israel, are your gods, who brought you up out of the land of Egypt!”
</p>

<p>
<a id="32-5"></a> <b>5</b> When Aaron saw this, he built an altar before the calf and proclaimed: “Tomorrow shall be a feast to the LORD.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="32-6"></a> <b>6</b> So the next day they arose, offered burnt offerings, and presented peace offerings. And the people sat down to eat and drink, and got up to indulge in revelry.
</p>

<p>
<a id="32-7"></a> <b>7</b> Then the LORD said to Moses, “Go down at once, for your people, whom you brought up out of the land of Egypt, have corrupted themselves. 
<a id="32-8"></a> <b>8</b> How quickly they have turned aside from the way that I commanded them! They have made for themselves a molten calf and have bowed down to it. They have sacrificed to it and said, ‘These, O Israel, are your gods, who brought you up out of the land of Egypt.&rsquo; ”
</p>

<p>
<a id="32-9"></a> <b>9</b> The LORD also said to Moses, “I have seen this people, and they are indeed a stiff-necked people. 
<a id="32-10"></a> <b>10</b> Now leave Me alone, so that My anger may burn against them and consume them. Then I will make you into a great nation.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="32-11"></a> <b>11</b> But Moses sought the favor of the LORD his God, saying, “O LORD, why does Your anger burn against Your people, whom You brought out of the land of Egypt with great power and a mighty hand? 
<a id="32-12"></a> <b>12</b> Why should the Egyptians declare, ‘He brought them out with evil intent, to kill them in the mountains and wipe them from the face of the earth&rsquo;? Turn from Your fierce anger and relent from doing harm to Your people. 
<a id="32-13"></a> <b>13</b> Remember Your servants Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, to whom You swore by Your very self when You declared, ‘I will make your descendants as numerous as the stars in the sky, and I will give your descendants all this land that I have promised, and it shall be their inheritance forever.&rsquo; ”
</p>

<p>
<a id="32-14"></a> <b>14</b> So the LORD relented from the calamity He had threatened to bring on His people.
</p>

<p>
<a id="32-15"></a> <b>15</b> Then Moses turned and went down the mountain with the two tablets of the Testimony in his hands. They were inscribed on both sides, front and back. 
<a id="32-16"></a> <b>16</b> The tablets were the work of God, and the writing was the writing of God, engraved on the tablets.
</p>

<p>
<a id="32-17"></a> <b>17</b> When Joshua heard the sound of the people shouting, he said to Moses, “The sound of war is in the camp.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="32-18"></a> <b>18</b> But Moses replied:
“It is neither the cry of victory nor the cry of defeat;
I hear the sound of singing!”
</p>

<p>
<a id="32-19"></a> <b>19</b> As Moses approached the camp and saw the calf and the dancing, he burned with anger and threw the tablets out of his hands, shattering them at the base of the mountain. 
<a id="32-20"></a> <b>20</b> Then he took the calf they had made, burned it in the fire, ground it to powder, and scattered the powder over the face of the water. Then he forced the Israelites to drink it.
<a id="32-21"></a> <b>21</b> “What did this people do to you,” Moses asked Aaron, “that you have led them into so great a sin?”
<a id="32-22"></a> <b>22</b> “Do not be enraged, my lord,” Aaron replied. “You yourself know that the people are intent on evil. 
<a id="32-23"></a> <b>23</b> They told me, ‘Make us gods who will go before us. As for this Moses who brought us up out of the land of Egypt, we do not know what has happened to him!&rsquo;
</p>

<p>
<a id="32-24"></a> <b>24</b> So I said to them, ‘Whoever has gold, let him take it off,&rsquo; and they gave it to me. And when I threw it into the fire, out came this calf!”
</p>

<p>
<a id="32-25"></a> <b>25</b> Moses saw that the people were out of control, for Aaron had let them run wild and become a laughingstock to their enemies. 
<a id="32-26"></a> <b>26</b> So Moses stood at the entrance to the camp and said, “Whoever is for the LORD, come to me.”
And all the Levites gathered around him.
<a id="32-27"></a> <b>27</b> He told them, “This is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says: ‘Each of you men is to fasten his sword to his side, go back and forth through the camp from gate to gate, and slay his brother, his friend, and his neighbor.&rsquo; ”
<a id="32-28"></a> <b>28</b> The Levites did as Moses commanded, and that day about three thousand of the people fell dead.
</p>

<p>
<a id="32-29"></a> <b>29</b> Afterward, Moses said, “Today you have been ordained for service to the LORD, since each man went against his son and his brother; so the LORD has bestowed a blessing on you this day.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="32-30"></a> <b>30</b> The next day Moses said to the people, “You have committed a great sin. Now I will go up to the LORD; perhaps I can make atonement for your sin.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="32-31"></a> <b>31</b> So Moses returned to the LORD and said, “Oh, what a great sin these people have committed! They have made gods of gold for themselves. 
<a id="32-32"></a> <b>32</b> Yet now, if You would only forgive their sin&#x2026;. But if not, please blot me out of the book that You have written.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="32-33"></a> <b>33</b> The LORD replied to Moses, “Whoever has sinned against Me, I will blot out of My book. 
<a id="32-34"></a> <b>34</b> Now go, lead the people to the place I described. Behold, My angel shall go before you. But on the day I settle accounts, I will punish them for their sin.”

is compassionate and gracious,
slow to anger,
abounding in loving devotion and faithfulness,

<p>
<a id="34-7"></a> <b>7</b> maintaining loving devotion to a thousand generations,
forgiving iniquity, transgression, and sin.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgeaf2bb8">
<p>
<a id="34-10"></a> <b>10</b> And the LORD said, “Behold, I am making a covenant. Before all your people I will perform wonders that have never been done in any nation in all the world. All the people among whom you live will see the LORD&rsquo;s work, for it is an awesome thing that I am doing with you.
</p>

<p>
<a id="34-11"></a> <b>11</b> Observe what I command you this day. I will drive out before you the Amorites, Canaanites, Hittites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites. 
<a id="34-12"></a> <b>12</b> Be careful not to make a treaty with the inhabitants of the land you are entering, lest they become a snare in your midst. 
<a id="34-13"></a> <b>13</b> Rather, you must tear down their altars, smash their sacred stones, and chop down their Asherah poles. 
<a id="34-14"></a> <b>14</b> For you must not worship any other god, for the LORD, whose name is Jealous, is a jealous God.
</p>

<p>
<a id="34-15"></a> <b>15</b> Do not make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land, for when they prostitute themselves to their gods and sacrifice to them, they will invite you, and you will eat their sacrifices. 
<a id="34-16"></a> <b>16</b> And when you take some of their daughters as brides for your sons, their daughters will prostitute themselves to their gods and cause your sons to do the same.
</p>

<p>
<a id="34-17"></a> <b>17</b> You shall make no molten gods for yourselves.
</p>

<p>
<a id="34-18"></a> <b>18</b> You are to keep the Feast of Unleavened Bread. For seven days at the appointed time in the month of Abib, you are to eat unleavened bread as I commanded you. For in the month of Abib you came out of Egypt.
</p>

<p>
<a id="34-19"></a> <b>19</b> The first offspring of every womb belongs to Me, including all the firstborn males among your livestock, whether cattle or sheep. 
<a id="34-20"></a> <b>20</b> You must redeem the firstborn of a donkey with a lamb; but if you do not redeem it, you are to break its neck. You must redeem all the firstborn of your sons. No one shall appear before Me empty-handed.
</p>

<p>
<a id="34-21"></a> <b>21</b> Six days you shall labor, but on the seventh day you shall rest; even in the seasons of plowing and harvesting, you must rest.
</p>

<p>
<a id="34-22"></a> <b>22</b> And you are to celebrate the Feast of Weeks with the firstfruits of the wheat harvest, and the Feast of Ingathering at the turn of the year. 
<a id="34-23"></a> <b>23</b> Three times a year all your males are to appear before the Lord GOD, the God of Israel. 
<a id="34-24"></a> <b>24</b> For I will drive out the nations before you and enlarge your borders, and no one will covet your land when you go up three times a year to appear before the LORD your God.
</p>

<p>
<a id="34-25"></a> <b>25</b> Do not offer the blood of a sacrifice to Me along with anything leavened, and do not let any of the sacrifice from the Passover Feast remain until morning.
</p>

<p>
<a id="34-26"></a> <b>26</b> Bring the best of the firstfruits of your soil to the house of the LORD your God.
You must not cook a young goat in its mother&rsquo;s milk.”
</p>

<a id="34-27"></a> <b>27</b> The LORD also said to Moses, “Write down these words, for in accordance with these words I have made a covenant with you and with Israel.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="34-28"></a> <b>28</b> So Moses was there with the LORD forty days and forty nights without eating bread or drinking water. He wrote on the tablets the words of the covenant&#x2014;the Ten Commandments.
</p>

<p>
<a id="34-29"></a> <b>29</b> And when Moses came down from Mount Sinai with the two tablets of the Testimony in his hands, he was unaware that his face had become radiant from speaking with the LORD. 
<a id="34-30"></a> <b>30</b> Aaron and all the Israelites looked at Moses, and behold, his face was radiant. And they were afraid to approach him.
</p>

<p>
<a id="34-31"></a> <b>31</b> But Moses called out to them; so Aaron and all the leaders of the congregation returned to him, and Moses spoke to them. 
<a id="34-32"></a> <b>32</b> And after this all the Israelites came near, and Moses commanded them to do everything that the LORD had told him on Mount Sinai.
</p>

<p>
<a id="34-33"></a> <b>33</b> When Moses had finished speaking with them, he put a veil over his face. 
<a id="34-34"></a> <b>34</b> But whenever Moses went in before the LORD to speak with Him, he would remove the veil until he came out. And when he came out, he would tell the Israelites what he had been commanded, 
<a id="34-35"></a> <b>35</b> and the Israelites would see that the face of Moses was radiant. So Moses would put the veil back over his face until he went in to speak with the LORD.

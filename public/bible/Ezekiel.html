<a id="1-1"></a> In the thirtieth year, on the fifth day of the fourth month, while I was among the exiles by the River Kebar, the heavens opened and I saw visions of God.
</p>

<p>
<a id="1-2"></a> <b>2</b> On the fifth day of the month&#x2014;it was the fifth year of the exile of King Jehoiachin&#x2014; 
<a id="1-3"></a> <b>3</b> the word of the LORD came directly to Ezekiel the priest, the son of Buzi, in the land of the Chaldeans by the River Kebar. And there the LORD&rsquo;s hand was upon him.

<h3 id="org70a58b0">The Four Living Creatures</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org70a58b0">
<p>
<a id="1-4"></a> <b>4</b> I looked and saw a whirlwind coming from the north, a great cloud with fire flashing back and forth and brilliant light all around it. In the center of the fire was a gleam like amber, 
<a id="1-5"></a> <b>5</b> and within it was the form of four living creatures.
</p>

<p>
And this was their appearance: They had a human form, 
<a id="1-6"></a> <b>6</b> but each had four faces and four wings. 
<a id="1-7"></a> <b>7</b> Their legs were straight, and the soles of their feet were like the hooves of a calf, gleaming like polished bronze.
</p>

<p>
<a id="1-8"></a> <b>8</b> Under their wings on their four sides they had human hands. All four living creatures had faces and wings, 
<a id="1-9"></a> <b>9</b> and their wings were touching one another. They did not turn as they moved; each one went straight ahead.
</p>

<p>
<a id="1-10"></a> <b>10</b> The form of their faces was that of a man, and each of the four had the face of a lion on the right side, the face of an ox on the left side, and also the face of an eagle. 
<a id="1-11"></a> <b>11</b> Such were their faces.
</p>

<p>
Their wings were spread upward; each had two wings touching the wings of the creature on either side, and two wings covering its body. 
<a id="1-12"></a> <b>12</b> Each creature went straight ahead. Wherever the spirit would go, they would go, without turning as they moved.
</p>

<p>
<a id="1-13"></a> <b>13</b> In the midst of the living creatures was the appearance of glowing coals of fire, or of torches. Fire moved back and forth between the living creatures; it was bright, and lightning flashed out of it. 
<a id="1-14"></a> <b>14</b> The creatures were darting back and forth as quickly as flashes of lightning.
</p>

<h3 id="org761cbd8">The Four Wheels</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org761cbd8">
<p>
<a id="1-15"></a> <b>15</b> When I looked at the living creatures, I saw a wheel on the ground beside each creature with its four faces. 
<a id="1-16"></a> <b>16</b> The workmanship of the wheels looked like the gleam of beryl, and all four had the same likeness. Their workmanship looked like a wheel within a wheel. 
<a id="1-17"></a> <b>17</b> As they moved, they went in any of the four directions, without pivoting as they moved. 
<a id="1-18"></a> <b>18</b> Their rims were high and awesome, and all four rims were full of eyes all around. 
<a id="1-19"></a> <b>19</b> So as the living creatures moved, the wheels moved beside them, and when the creatures rose from the ground, the wheels also rose.
</p>

<p>
<a id="1-20"></a> <b>20</b> Wherever the spirit would go, they would go, and the wheels would rise alongside them, because the spirit of the living creatures was in the wheels. 
<a id="1-21"></a> <b>21</b> When the creatures moved, the wheels moved; when the creatures stood still, the wheels stood still; and when the creatures rose from the ground, the wheels rose alongside them, because the spirit of the living creatures was in the wheels.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-orgd526dc1" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orgd526dc1">The Divine Glory</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgd526dc1">
<p>
<a id="1-22"></a> <b>22</b> Spread out above the heads of the living creatures was the likeness of an awesome expanse, gleaming like crystal. 
<a id="1-23"></a> <b>23</b> And under the expanse, their wings stretched out toward one another. Each one also had two wings covering its body.
</p>

<p>
<a id="1-24"></a> <b>24</b> When the creatures moved, I heard the sound of their wings like the roar of many waters, like the voice of the Almighty, like the tumult of an army.
</p>

<p>
When they stood still, they lowered their wings. 
<a id="1-25"></a> <b>25</b> And there came a voice from above the expanse over their heads as they stood still with their wings lowered.
</p>

<p>
<a id="1-26"></a> <b>26</b> Above the expanse over their heads was the likeness of a throne with the appearance of sapphire, and on the throne high above was a figure like that of a man. 
<a id="1-27"></a> <b>27</b> From what seemed to be His waist up, I saw a gleam like amber, with what looked like fire within it all around. And from what seemed to be His waist down, I saw what looked like fire; and brilliant light surrounded Him.
</p>

<p>
<a id="1-28"></a> <b>28</b> The appearance of the brilliant light all around Him was like that of a rainbow in a cloud on a rainy day. This was the appearance of the likeness of the glory of the LORD. And when I saw it, I fell facedown and heard a voice speaking.

<p>
<a id="2-1"></a> “Son of man,” He said to me, “stand up on your feet and I will speak to you.” 
<a id="2-2"></a> <b>2</b> And as He spoke to me, the Spirit entered me and set me on my feet, and I heard Him speaking to me.
</p>

<p>
<a id="2-3"></a> <b>3</b> “Son of man,” He said to me, “I am sending you to the Israelites, to a rebellious nation that has rebelled against Me. To this very day they and their fathers have rebelled against Me. 
<a id="2-4"></a> <b>4</b> They are obstinate and stubborn children. I am sending you to them, and you are to say to them, ‘This is what the Lord GOD says.&rsquo;
</p>

<p>
<a id="2-5"></a> <b>5</b> And whether they listen or refuse to listen&#x2014;for they are a rebellious house&#x2014;they will know that a prophet has been among them.
</p>

<p>
<a id="2-6"></a> <b>6</b> But you, son of man, do not be afraid of them or their words. Do not be afraid, though briers and thorns surround you, and you dwell among scorpions. Do not be afraid of their words or dismayed by their presence, though they are a rebellious house. 
<a id="2-7"></a> <b>7</b> But speak My words to them, whether they listen or refuse to listen, for they are rebellious.
</p>

<p>
<a id="2-8"></a> <b>8</b> And you, son of man, listen to what I tell you. Do not be rebellious like that rebellious house. Open your mouth and eat what I give you.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="2-9"></a> <b>9</b> Then I looked and saw a hand reaching out to me, and in it was a scroll, 
<a id="2-10"></a> <b>10</b> which He unrolled before me. And written on the front and back of it were words of lamentation, mourning, and woe.

<a id="3-2"></a> <b>2</b> So I opened my mouth, and He fed me the scroll.

<a id="3-5"></a> <b>5</b> For you are not being sent to a people of unfamiliar speech or difficult language, but to the house of Israel&#x2014; 
<a id="3-6"></a> <b>6</b> not to the many peoples of unfamiliar speech and difficult language whose words you cannot understand. Surely if I had sent you to them, they would have listened to you.
</p>

<p>
<a id="3-7"></a> <b>7</b> But the house of Israel will be unwilling to listen to you, since they are unwilling to listen to Me. For the whole house of Israel is hard-headed and hard-hearted.
</p>

<p>
<a id="3-8"></a> <b>8</b> Behold, I will make your face as hard as their faces, and your forehead as hard as their foreheads. 
<a id="3-9"></a> <b>9</b> I will make your forehead like a diamond, harder than flint. Do not be afraid of them or dismayed at their presence, even though they are a rebellious house.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="3-10"></a> <b>10</b> “Son of man,” He added, “listen carefully to all the words I speak to you, and take them to heart. 
<a id="3-11"></a> <b>11</b> Go to your people, the exiles; speak to them and tell them, ‘This is what the Lord GOD says,&rsquo; whether they listen or refuse to listen.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="3-12"></a> <b>12</b> Then the Spirit lifted me up, and I heard a great rumbling sound behind me: ‘Blessed be the glory of the LORD in His dwelling place!&rsquo; 
<a id="3-13"></a> <b>13</b> It was the sound of the wings of the living creatures brushing against one another and the sound of the wheels beside them, a great rumbling sound.
</p>

<p>
<a id="3-14"></a> <b>14</b> So the Spirit lifted me up and took me away, and I went in bitterness and in the anger of my spirit, with the strong hand of the LORD upon me. 
<a id="3-15"></a> <b>15</b> I came to the exiles at Tel-abib who dwelt by the River Kebar. And for seven days I sat where they sat and remained there among them, overwhelmed.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org84366c5">
<p>
<a id="3-16"></a> <b>16</b> At the end of seven days the word of the LORD came to me, saying,
<a id="3-17"></a> <b>17</b> “Son of man, I have made you a watchman for the house of Israel. Whenever you hear a word from My mouth, give them a warning from Me.
</p>

<p>
<a id="3-18"></a> <b>18</b> If I say to the wicked man, ‘You will surely die,&rsquo; but you do not warn him or speak out to warn him from his wicked way to save his life, that wicked man will die in his iniquity, and I will hold you responsible for his blood. 
<a id="3-19"></a> <b>19</b> But if you warn a wicked man and he does not turn from his wickedness and his wicked way, he will die in his iniquity, but you will have saved yourself.
</p>

<p>
<a id="3-20"></a> <b>20</b> Now if a righteous man turns from his righteousness and commits iniquity, and I put a stumbling block before him, he will die. If you did not warn him, he will die in his sin, and the righteous acts he did will not be remembered. And I will hold you responsible for his blood. 
<a id="3-21"></a> <b>21</b> But if you warn the righteous man not to sin, and he does not sin, he will indeed live because he heeded your warning, and you will have saved yourself.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="3-22"></a> <b>22</b> And there the hand of the LORD was upon me, and He said to me, “Get up, go out to the plain, and there I will speak with you.”

<p>
<a id="3-23"></a> <b>23</b> So I got up and went out to the plain, and behold, the glory of the LORD was present there, like the glory I had seen by the River Kebar, and I fell facedown.
</p>

<p>
<a id="3-24"></a> <b>24</b> Then the Spirit entered me and set me on my feet. He spoke with me and said, “Go, shut yourself inside your house.

<a id="3-26"></a> <b>26</b> I will make your tongue stick to the roof of your mouth, and you will be silent and unable to rebuke them, though they are a rebellious house.

<p>
<a id="3-27"></a> <b>27</b> But when I speak with you, I will open your mouth, and you are to tell them, ‘This is what the Lord GOD says.&rsquo; Whoever listens, let him listen; and whoever refuses, let him refuse, for they are a rebellious house.

<p>
<a id="4-13"></a> <b>13</b> Then the LORD said, “This is how the Israelites will eat their defiled bread among the nations to which I will banish them.”

</p>

<p>
<a id="8-1"></a> In the sixth year, on the fifth day of the sixth month, I was sitting in my house, and the elders of Judah were sitting before me; and there the hand of the Lord GOD fell upon me.
</p>

<p>
<a id="8-2"></a> <b>2</b> Then I looked and saw a figure like that of a man. From His waist down His appearance was like fire, and from His waist up He was as bright as the gleam of amber. 
<a id="8-3"></a> <b>3</b> He stretched out what looked like a hand and took me by the hair of my head. Then the Spirit lifted me up between earth and heaven and carried me in visions of God to Jerusalem, to the entrance of the north gate of the inner court, where the idol that provokes jealousy was seated.
</p>

<p>
<a id="8-4"></a> <b>4</b> And there I saw the glory of the God of Israel, like the vision I had seen in the plain.
<a id="8-5"></a> <b>5</b> “Son of man,” He said to me, “now lift up your eyes to the north.”
</p>

<p>
So I lifted up my eyes to the north, and in the entrance north of the Altar Gate I saw this idol of jealousy.
</p>

<p>
<a id="8-6"></a> <b>6</b> “Son of man,” He said to me, “do you see what they are doing&#x2014;the great abominations that the house of Israel is committing&#x2014;to drive Me far from My sanctuary? Yet you will see even greater abominations.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="8-7"></a> <b>7</b> Then He brought me to the entrance to the court, and I looked and saw a hole in the wall.
</p>

<p>
<a id="8-8"></a> <b>8</b> “Son of man,” He told me, “dig through the wall.”
</p>

<p>
So I dug through the wall and discovered a doorway.
</p>

<p>
<a id="8-9"></a> <b>9</b> Then He said to me, “Go in and see the wicked abominations they are committing here.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="8-10"></a> <b>10</b> So I went in and looked, and engraved all around the wall was every kind of crawling creature and detestable beast, along with all the idols of the house of Israel. 
<a id="8-11"></a> <b>11</b> Before them stood seventy elders of the house of Israel, with Jaazaniah son of Shaphan standing among them. Each had a censer in his hand, and a fragrant cloud of incense was rising.
</p>

<p>
<a id="8-12"></a> <b>12</b> “Son of man,” He said to me, “do you see what the elders of the house of Israel are doing in the darkness, each at the shrine of his own idol? For they are saying, ‘The LORD does not see us; the LORD has forsaken the land.&rsquo; ”
</p>

<p>
<a id="8-13"></a> <b>13</b> Again, He told me, “You will see them committing even greater abominations.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="8-14"></a> <b>14</b> Then He brought me to the entrance of the north gate of the house of the LORD, and I saw women sitting there, weeping for Tammuz.
</p>

<p>
<a id="8-15"></a> <b>15</b> “Son of man,” He said to me, “do you see this? Yet you will see even greater abominations than these.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="8-16"></a> <b>16</b> So He brought me to the inner court of the house of the LORD, and there at the entrance to the temple of the LORD, between the portico and the altar, were about twenty-five men with their backs to the temple of the LORD and their faces toward the east; and they were bowing to the east in worship of the sun.
</p>

<p>
<a id="8-17"></a> <b>17</b> “Son of man,” He said to me, “do you see this? Is it not enough for the house of Judah to commit the abominations they are practicing here, that they must also fill the land with violence and continually provoke Me to anger? Look, they are even putting the branch to their nose! 
<a id="8-18"></a> <b>18</b> Therefore I will respond with wrath. I will not look on them with pity, nor will I spare them. Although they shout loudly in My ears, I will not listen to them.”

<p>
<a id="9-1"></a> Then I heard Him call out in a loud voice, saying, “Draw near, O executioners of the city, each with a weapon of destruction in hand.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="9-2"></a> <b>2</b> And I saw six men coming from the direction of the Upper Gate, which faces north, each with a weapon of slaughter in his hand. With them was another man clothed in linen who had a writing kit at his side. And they came in and stood beside the bronze altar.
</p>

<p>
<a id="9-3"></a> <b>3</b> Then the glory of the God of Israel rose from above the cherubim, where it had been, and moved to the threshold of the temple. And He called to the man clothed in linen who had the writing kit at his side.
<a id="9-4"></a> <b>4</b> “Go throughout the city of Jerusalem,” said the LORD, “and put a mark on the foreheads of the men sighing and groaning over all the abominations committed there.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="9-5"></a> <b>5</b> And as I listened, He said to the others, “Follow him through the city and start killing; do not show pity or spare anyone! 
<a id="9-6"></a> <b>6</b> Slaughter the old men, the young men and maidens, the women and children; but do not go near anyone who has the mark. Now begin at My sanctuary.”
</p>

<p>
So they began with the elders who were before the temple.
</p>

<p>
<a id="9-7"></a> <b>7</b> Then He told them, “Defile the temple and fill the courts with the slain. Go forth!”
</p>

<p>
So they went out and began killing throughout the city.
</p>

<p>
<a id="9-8"></a> <b>8</b> While they were killing, I was left alone. And I fell facedown and cried out, “Oh, Lord GOD, when You pour out Your wrath on Jerusalem, will You destroy the entire remnant of Israel?”
</p>

<p>
<a id="9-9"></a> <b>9</b> He replied, “The iniquity of the house of Israel and Judah is exceedingly great. The land is full of bloodshed, and the city is full of perversity. For they say, ‘The LORD has forsaken the land; the LORD does not see.&rsquo; 
<a id="9-10"></a> <b>10</b> But as for Me, I will not look on them with pity, nor will I spare them. I will bring their deeds down upon their own heads.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="9-11"></a> <b>11</b> Then the man clothed in linen with the writing kit at his side reported back, “I have done as You commanded.”

<a id="10-1"></a> And I looked and saw above the expanse, above the heads of the cherubim, the likeness of a throne of sapphire. 
<a id="10-2"></a> <b>2</b> And the LORD said to the man clothed in linen, “Go inside the wheelwork beneath the cherubim. Fill your hands with burning coals from among the cherubim and scatter them over the city.” And as I watched, he went in.
</p>

<p>
<a id="10-3"></a> <b>3</b> Now when the man went in, the cherubim were standing on the south side of the temple, and a cloud filled the inner court. 
<a id="10-4"></a> <b>4</b> Then the glory of the LORD rose from above the cherubim and stood over the threshold of the temple. The temple was filled with the cloud, and the court was filled with the brightness of the glory of the LORD. 
<a id="10-5"></a> <b>5</b> The sound of the wings of the cherubim could be heard as far as the outer court, like the voice of God Almighty when He speaks.
</p>

<p>
<a id="10-6"></a> <b>6</b> When the LORD commanded the man clothed in linen, saying, “Take fire from within the wheelwork, from among the cherubim,” the man went in and stood beside a wheel. 
<a id="10-7"></a> <b>7</b> Then one of the cherubim reached out his hand and took some of the fire that was among them. And he put it into the hands of the man clothed in linen, who received it and went out. 8(The cherubim appeared to have the form of human hands under their wings.)
</p>

<p>
<a id="10-9"></a> <b>9</b> Then I looked and saw four wheels beside the cherubim, one wheel beside each cherub. And the wheels gleamed like a beryl stone. 
<a id="10-10"></a> <b>10</b> As for their appearance, all four had the same form, like a wheel within a wheel. 
<a id="10-11"></a> <b>11</b> When they moved, they would go in any of the four directions, without turning as they moved. For wherever the head faced, the cherubim would go in that direction, without turning as they moved.
</p>

<p>
<a id="10-12"></a> <b>12</b> Their entire bodies, including their backs, hands, and wings, were full of eyes all around, as were their four wheels. 
<a id="10-13"></a> <b>13</b> I heard the wheels being called “the whirling wheels.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="10-14"></a> <b>14</b> Each of the cherubim had four faces: the first face was that of a cherub, the second that of a man, the third that of a lion, and the fourth that of an eagle.
</p>

<p>
<a id="10-15"></a> <b>15</b> Then the cherubim rose upward. These were the living creatures I had seen by the River Kebar. 
<a id="10-16"></a> <b>16</b> When the cherubim moved, the wheels moved beside them, and even when they spread their wings to rise from the ground, the wheels did not veer away from their side. 
<a id="10-17"></a> <b>17</b> When the cherubim stood still, the wheels also stood still, and when they ascended, the wheels ascended with them, for the spirit of the living creatures was in the wheels.
</p>

<p>
<a id="10-18"></a> <b>18</b> Then the glory of the LORD moved away from the threshold of the temple and stood above the cherubim. 
<a id="10-19"></a> <b>19</b> As I watched, the cherubim lifted their wings and rose up from the ground, with the wheels beside them as they went. And they stopped at the entrance of the east gate of the house of the LORD, with the glory of the God of Israel above them.
</p>

<p>
<a id="10-20"></a> <b>20</b> These were the living creatures I had seen beneath the God of Israel by the River Kebar, and I knew that they were cherubim. 
<a id="10-21"></a> <b>21</b> Each had four faces and four wings, with what looked like human hands under their wings.

<a id="11-18"></a> <b>18</b> When they return to it, they will remove all its detestable things and all its abominations. 
<a id="11-19"></a> <b>19</b> And I will give them singleness of heart and put a new spirit within them; I will remove their heart of stone and give them a heart of flesh,

</p>

<p>
<a id="12-3"></a> <b>3</b> Therefore, son of man, pack your bags for exile. In broad daylight, set out from your place and go to another as they watch. Perhaps they will understand, though they are a rebellious house. 
<a id="12-4"></a> <b>4</b> Bring out your baggage for exile by day, as they watch. Then in the evening, as they watch, go out like those who go into exile.
</p>

<p>
<a id="12-5"></a> <b>5</b> As they watch, dig through the wall and carry your belongings out through it. 
<a id="12-6"></a> <b>6</b> And as they watch, lift your bags to your shoulder and take them out at dusk; cover your face so that you cannot see the land. For I have made you a sign to the house of Israel.”

<p>
<a id="12-11"></a> <b>11</b> You are to say, ‘I am a sign to you.&rsquo; Just as it happened here, so will it be done to them; they will go into exile as captives. 
<a id="12-12"></a> <b>12</b> And at dusk the prince among them will lift his bags to his shoulder and go out. They will dig through the wall to bring him out. He will cover his face so he cannot see the land. 
<a id="12-13"></a> <b>13</b> But I will spread My net over him, and he will be caught in My snare. I will bring him to Babylon, the land of the Chaldeans; yet he will not see it, and there he will die.
</p>

<p>
<a id="12-14"></a> <b>14</b> And I will scatter to every wind all the attendants around him and all his troops, and I will draw a sword to chase after them.

<a id="16-27"></a> <b>27</b> Therefore I stretched out My hand against you and reduced your portion. I gave you over to the desire of those who hate you, the daughters of the Philistines, who were ashamed of your lewd conduct. 
<a id="16-28"></a> <b>28</b> Then you prostituted yourself with the Assyrians, because you were not yet satisfied. Even after that, you were still not satisfied. 
<a id="16-29"></a> <b>29</b> So you extended your promiscuity to Chaldea, the land of merchants&#x2014;but even with this you were not satisfied!
</p>

<p>
<a id="16-30"></a> <b>30</b> How weak-willed is your heart, declares the Lord GOD, while you do all these things, the acts of a shameless prostitute! 
<a id="16-31"></a> <b>31</b> But when you built your mounds at the head of every street and made your lofty shrines in every public square, you were not even like a prostitute, because you scorned payment.
</p>

<p>
<a id="16-32"></a> <b>32</b> You adulterous wife! You receive strangers instead of your own husband! 
<a id="16-33"></a> <b>33</b> Men give gifts to all their prostitutes, but you gave gifts to all your lovers. You bribed them to come to you from everywhere for your illicit favors. 
<a id="16-34"></a> <b>34</b> So your prostitution is the opposite of that of other women: No one solicited your favors, and you paid a fee instead of receiving one; so you are the very opposite!

<a id="16-35"></a> <b>35</b> Therefore, O prostitute, hear the word of the LORD! 
<a id="16-36"></a> <b>36</b> This is what the Lord GOD says: Because you poured out your wealth and exposed your nakedness in your promiscuity with your lovers and with all your detestable idols, and because of the blood of your children which you gave to them, 
<a id="16-37"></a> <b>37</b> therefore I will surely gather all the lovers with whom you found pleasure, all those you loved and all those you hated. I will gather them against you from all around and expose you before them, and they will see you completely naked. 
<a id="16-38"></a> <b>38</b> And I will sentence you to the punishment of women who commit adultery and those who shed blood; so I will bring upon you the wrath of your bloodshed and jealousy.
</p>

<p>
<a id="16-39"></a> <b>39</b> Then I will deliver you into the hands of your lovers, and they will level your mounds and tear down your lofty shrines. They will strip off your clothes, take your fine jewelry, and leave you naked and bare. 
<a id="16-40"></a> <b>40</b> They will bring a mob against you, who will stone you and cut you to pieces with their swords. 
<a id="16-41"></a> <b>41</b> Then they will burn down your houses and execute judgment against you in the sight of many women.
</p>

<p>
I will put an end to your prostitution, and you will never again pay your lovers. 
<a id="16-42"></a> <b>42</b> So I will lay to rest My wrath against you, and My jealousy will turn away from you. Then I will be calm and no longer angry.
</p>

<p>
<a id="16-43"></a> <b>43</b> Because you did not remember the days of your youth, but enraged Me with all these things, I will surely bring your deeds down upon your own head, declares the Lord GOD. Have you not committed this lewdness on top of all your other abominations?
</p>

<p>
<a id="16-44"></a> <b>44</b> Behold, all who speak in proverbs will quote this proverb about you:
</p>

<p>
‘Like mother, like daughter.&rsquo;
</p>

<p>
<a id="16-45"></a> <b>45</b> You are the daughter of your mother, who despised her husband and children. You are the sister of your sisters, who despised their husbands and children. Your mother was a Hittite and your father an Amorite. 
<a id="16-46"></a> <b>46</b> Your older sister was Samaria, who lived with her daughters to your north; and your younger sister was Sodom, who lived with her daughters to your south. 
<a id="16-47"></a> <b>47</b> And you not only walked in their ways and practiced their abominations, but soon you were more depraved than they were.
</p>

<p>
<a id="16-48"></a> <b>48</b> As surely as I live, declares the Lord GOD, your sister Sodom and her daughters never did as you and your daughters have done. 
<a id="16-49"></a> <b>49</b> Now this was the iniquity of your sister Sodom: She and her daughters were arrogant, overfed, and complacent; they did not help the poor and needy. 
<a id="16-50"></a> <b>50</b> Thus they were haughty and committed abominations before Me. Therefore I removed them, as you have seen.
</p>

<p>
<a id="16-51"></a> <b>51</b> Furthermore, Samaria did not commit half the sins you did. You have multiplied your abominations beyond theirs, and all the abominations you have committed have made your sisters appear righteous. 
<a id="16-52"></a> <b>52</b> So now you must bear your disgrace, since you have brought justification for your sisters. For they appear more righteous than you, because your sins were more vile than theirs. So you too must bear your shame and disgrace, since you have made your sisters appear righteous.
</p>

<p>
<a id="16-53"></a> <b>53</b> But I will restore Sodom and her daughters from captivity, as well as Samaria and her daughters. And I will restore you along with them. 
<a id="16-54"></a> <b>54</b> So you will bear your disgrace and be ashamed of all you did to comfort them.
</p>

<p>
<a id="16-55"></a> <b>55</b> And your sisters, Sodom with her daughters and Samaria with her daughters, will return to their former state. You and your daughters will also return to your former state. 
<a id="16-56"></a> <b>56</b> Did you not treat your sister Sodom as an object of scorn in the day of your pride, 
<a id="16-57"></a> <b>57</b> before your wickedness was uncovered? Even so, you are now scorned by the daughters of Edom and all those around her, and by the daughters of the Philistines&#x2014;all those around you who despise you. 
<a id="16-58"></a> <b>58</b> You will bear the consequences of your lewdness and your abominations, declares the LORD.

</p>

<p>
‘A great eagle with great wings and long pinions,
</p>

<p>
full of feathers of many colors,
</p>

<p>
came to Lebanon
</p>

<p>
and took away the top of the cedar.

<p>
<a id="17-4"></a> <b>4</b> He plucked off its topmost shoot,

<p>
carried it to the land of merchants,

<p>
and planted it in a city of traders.

<p>
<a id="17-5"></a> <b>5</b> He took some of the seed of the land
</p>

<p>
and planted it in fertile soil;
</p>

<p>
he placed it by abundant waters
</p>

<p>
and set it out like a willow.
</p>

<p>
<a id="17-6"></a> <b>6</b> It sprouted and became a spreading vine,
</p>

<p>
low in height, with branches turned toward him;
</p>

<p>
yet its roots remained where it stood.
</p>

<p>
So it became a vine and yielded branches
</p>

<p>
and sent out shoots.
</p>

<p>
<a id="17-7"></a> <b>7</b> But there was another great eagle
</p>

<p>
with great wings and many feathers.
</p>

<p>
And behold, this vine bent its roots toward him.
</p>

<p>
It stretched out its branches to him from its planting bed,
</p>

<p>
so that he might water it.
</p>

<p>
<a id="17-8"></a> <b>8</b> It had been planted in good soil
</p>

<p>
by abundant waters

<p>
in order to yield branches and bear fruit
</p>

<p>
and become a splendid vine.&rsquo;
</p>

<p>
<a id="17-9"></a> <b>9</b> So you are to tell them that this is what the Lord GOD says:

<p>
‘Will it flourish?
</p>

<p>
Will it not be uprooted and stripped of its fruit
</p>

<p>
so that it shrivels?

<p>
All its foliage will wither!

It will not take a strong arm or many people

<a id="17-11"></a> <b>11</b> Then the word of the LORD came to me, saying,
<a id="17-12"></a> <b>12</b> “Now say to this rebellious house: ‘Do you not know what these things mean?&rsquo;
</p>

<p>
Tell them, ‘Behold, the king of Babylon came to Jerusalem, carried off its king and officials, and brought them back with him to Babylon. 
<a id="17-13"></a> <b>13</b> He took a member of the royal family and made a covenant with him, putting him under oath. Then he carried away the leading men of the land, 
<a id="17-14"></a> <b>14</b> so that the kingdom would be brought low, unable to lift itself up, surviving only by keeping his covenant.
</p>

<p>
<a id="17-15"></a> <b>15</b> But this king rebelled against Babylon by sending his envoys to Egypt to ask for horses and a large army. Will he flourish? Will the one who does such things escape? Can he break a covenant and yet escape?&rsquo;
</p>

<p>
16‘As surely as I live,&rsquo; declares the Lord GOD, ‘he will die in Babylon, in the land of the king who enthroned him, whose oath he despised and whose covenant he broke.

<p>
<a id="17-19"></a> <b>19</b> Therefore this is what the Lord GOD says: ‘As surely as I live, I will bring down upon his head My oath that he despised and My covenant that he broke.

<a id="17-22"></a> <b>22</b> This is what the Lord GOD says:

<p>
‘I will take a shoot from the lofty top of the cedar,
</p>

<p>
and I will set it out.
</p>

<p>
I will pluck a tender sprig from its topmost shoots,
</p>

<p>
and I will plant it on a high and lofty mountain.
</p>

<p>
<a id="17-23"></a> <b>23</b> I will plant it on the mountain heights of Israel

it will yield fruit

<p>
<a id="18-1"></a> Then the word of the LORD came to me, saying,
<a id="18-2"></a> <b>2</b> “What do you people mean by quoting this proverb about the land of Israel:
</p>

<p>
‘The fathers have eaten sour grapes,

<p>
and the teeth of the children are set on edge&rsquo;?
</p>

</p>

<p>
<a id="18-5"></a> <b>5</b> Now suppose a man is righteous and does what is just and right:
</p>

<p>
<a id="18-6"></a> <b>6</b> He does not eat at the mountain
</p>

<p>
or look to the idols of the house of Israel.
</p>

<p>
He does not defile his neighbor&rsquo;s wife
</p>

<p>
or approach a woman during her period.
</p>

<p>
<a id="18-7"></a> <b>7</b> He does not oppress another,
</p>

<p>
but restores the pledge to the debtor.
</p>

<p>
He does not commit robbery,
</p>

<p>
but gives his bread to the hungry
</p>

<p>
and covers the naked with clothing.
</p>

<p>
<a id="18-8"></a> <b>8</b> He does not engage in usury
</p>

<p>
or take excess interest,
</p>

<p>
but he withholds his hand from iniquity
</p>

<p>
and executes true justice between men.
</p>

<p>
<a id="18-9"></a> <b>9</b> He follows My statutes
</p>

<p>
and faithfully keeps My ordinances.
</p>

<p>
That man is righteous;
</p>

<p>
surely he will live,
</p>

<p>
declares the Lord GOD.
</p>

<p>
<a id="18-10"></a> <b>10</b> Now suppose that man has a violent son, who sheds blood or does any of these things, 
<a id="18-11"></a> <b>11</b> though the father has done none of them:
</p>

<p>
Indeed, the son eats at the mountain
</p>

<p>
and defiles his neighbor&rsquo;s wife.
</p>

<p>
<a id="18-12"></a> <b>12</b> He oppresses the poor and needy;
</p>

<p>
he commits robbery
</p>

<p>
and does not restore a pledge.
</p>

<p>
He lifts his eyes to idols;
</p>

<p>
he commits abominations.
</p>

<p>
<a id="18-13"></a> <b>13</b> He engages in usury
</p>

<p>
and takes excess interest.
</p>

<p>
Will this son live? He will not! Since he has committed all these abominations, he will surely die; his blood will be on his own head.
</p>

<p>
<a id="18-14"></a> <b>14</b> Now suppose this son has a son who sees all the sins his father has committed, considers them, and does not do likewise:
</p>

<p>
<a id="18-15"></a> <b>15</b> He does not eat at the mountain
</p>

<p>
or look to the idols of the house of Israel.
</p>

<p>
He does not defile his neighbor&rsquo;s wife.
</p>

<p>
<a id="18-16"></a> <b>16</b> He does not oppress another,
</p>

<p>
or retain a pledge, or commit robbery.
</p>

<p>
He gives his bread to the hungry
</p>

<p>
and covers the naked with clothing.
</p>

<p>
<a id="18-17"></a> <b>17</b> He withholds his hand from harming the poor
</p>

<p>
and takes no interest or usury.
</p>

<p>
He keeps My ordinances
</p>

<p>
and follows My statutes.
</p>

<p>
Such a man will not die for his father&rsquo;s iniquity. He will surely live.
</p>

<p>
<a id="18-18"></a> <b>18</b> As for his father, he will die for his own iniquity, because he practiced extortion, robbed his brother, and did what was wrong among his people.
</p>

<p>
<a id="18-19"></a> <b>19</b> Yet you may ask, ‘Why shouldn&rsquo;t the son bear the iniquity of his father?&rsquo;
</p>

<p>
Since the son has done what is just and right, carefully observing all My statutes, he will surely live.
</p>

<p>
<a id="18-20"></a> <b>20</b> The soul who sins is the one who will die. A son will not bear the iniquity of his father, and a father will not bear the iniquity of his son. The righteousness of the righteous man will fall upon him, and the wickedness of the wicked man will fall upon him.
</p>

<p>
<a id="18-21"></a> <b>21</b> But if the wicked man turns from all the sins he has committed, keeps all My statutes, and does what is just and right, he will surely live; he will not die. 
<a id="18-22"></a> <b>22</b> None of the transgressions he has committed will be held against him. Because of the righteousness he has practiced, he will live. 
<a id="18-23"></a> <b>23</b> Do I take any pleasure in the death of the wicked? declares the Lord GOD. Wouldn&rsquo;t I prefer that he turn from his ways and live?
</p>

<p>
<a id="18-24"></a> <b>24</b> But if a righteous man turns from his righteousness and practices iniquity, committing the same abominations as the wicked, will he live? None of the righteous acts he did will be remembered. Because of the unfaithfulness and sin he has committed, he will die.
</p>

<p>
<a id="18-25"></a> <b>25</b> Yet you say, ‘The way of the Lord is not just.&rsquo;
</p>

<p>
Hear now, O house of Israel: Is it My way that is unjust? Is it not your ways that are unjust?
</p>

<p>
<a id="18-26"></a> <b>26</b> If a righteous man turns from his righteousness and practices iniquity, he will die for this. He will die because of the iniquity he has committed.
</p>

<p>
<a id="18-27"></a> <b>27</b> But if a wicked man turns from the wickedness he has committed and does what is just and right, he will save his life. 
<a id="18-28"></a> <b>28</b> Because he considered and turned from all the transgressions he had committed, he will surely live; he will not die.
</p>

<p>
<a id="18-29"></a> <b>29</b> Yet the house of Israel says, ‘The way of the Lord is not just.&rsquo;
</p>

<p>
Are My ways unjust, O house of Israel? Is it not your ways that are unjust?
</p>

<p>
<a id="18-30"></a> <b>30</b> Therefore, O house of Israel, I will judge you, each according to his ways, declares the Lord GOD. Repent and turn from all your transgressions, so that your iniquity will not become your downfall. 
<a id="18-31"></a> <b>31</b> Cast away from yourselves all the transgressions you have committed, and fashion for yourselves a new heart and a new spirit. Why should you die, O house of Israel?
</p>

<p>
<a id="18-32"></a> <b>32</b> For I take no pleasure in anyone&rsquo;s death, declares the Lord GOD. So repent and live!

<p>
<a id="20-1"></a> In the seventh year, on the tenth day of the fifth month, some of the elders of Israel came to inquire of the LORD, and they sat down before me.
</p>

<p>
<a id="20-2"></a> <b>2</b> Then the word of the LORD came to me, saying,
<a id="20-3"></a> <b>3</b> “Son of man, speak to the elders of Israel and tell them that this is what the Lord GOD says: Have you come to inquire of Me? As surely as I live, I will not be consulted by you, declares the Lord GOD.
</p>

<p>
<a id="20-4"></a> <b>4</b> Will you judge them, will you judge them, son of man? Confront them with the abominations of their fathers 
<a id="20-5"></a> <b>5</b> and tell them that this is what the Lord GOD says: On the day I chose Israel, I swore an oath to the descendants of the house of Jacob and made Myself known to them in the land of Egypt. With an uplifted hand I said to them, ‘I am the LORD your God.&rsquo;
</p>

<p>
<a id="20-6"></a> <b>6</b> On that day I swore to bring them out of the land of Egypt into a land that I had searched out for them, a land flowing with milk and honey, the glory of all lands. 
<a id="20-7"></a> <b>7</b> And I said to them: ‘Each of you must throw away the abominations before his eyes, and you must not defile yourselves with the idols of Egypt. I am the LORD your God.&rsquo;
</p>

<p>
<a id="20-8"></a> <b>8</b> But they rebelled against Me and refused to listen. None of them cast away the abominations before their eyes, and they did not forsake the idols of Egypt. So I resolved to pour out My wrath upon them and vent My anger against them in the land of Egypt. 
<a id="20-9"></a> <b>9</b> But I acted for the sake of My name, that it should not be profaned in the eyes of the nations among whom they were living, in whose sight I had revealed Myself to Israel by bringing them out of the land of Egypt.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org55adee1">
<p>
<a id="20-10"></a> <b>10</b> So I brought them out of the land of Egypt and led them into the wilderness. 
<a id="20-11"></a> <b>11</b> And I gave them My statutes and made known to them My ordinances&#x2014;for the man who does these things will live by them. 
<a id="20-12"></a> <b>12</b> I also gave them My Sabbaths as a sign between us, so that they would know that I am the LORD who sanctifies them.
</p>

<p>
<a id="20-13"></a> <b>13</b> Yet the house of Israel rebelled against Me in the wilderness. They did not follow My statutes and they rejected My ordinances&#x2014;though the man who does these things will live by them&#x2014;and they utterly profaned My Sabbaths. Then I resolved to pour out My wrath upon them and put an end to them in the wilderness. 
<a id="20-14"></a> <b>14</b> But I acted for the sake of My name, so that it would not be profaned in the eyes of the nations in whose sight I had brought them out.

<p>
<a id="20-15"></a> <b>15</b> Moreover, with an uplifted hand I swore to them in the wilderness that I would not bring them into the land that I had given them&#x2014;a land flowing with milk and honey, the glory of all lands&#x2014; 
<a id="20-16"></a> <b>16</b> because they kept rejecting My ordinances, refusing to walk in My statutes, and profaning My Sabbaths; for their hearts continually went after their idols. 
<a id="20-17"></a> <b>17</b> Yet I looked on them with pity and did not destroy them or bring them to an end in the wilderness.
</p>

<p>
<a id="20-18"></a> <b>18</b> In the wilderness I said to their children: ‘Do not walk in the statutes of your fathers or keep their ordinances or defile yourselves with their idols. 
<a id="20-19"></a> <b>19</b> I am the LORD your God; walk in My statutes, keep My ordinances, and practice them. 
<a id="20-20"></a> <b>20</b> Keep My Sabbaths holy, that they may be a sign between us, so that you may know that I am the LORD your God.&rsquo;
</p>

<p>
<a id="20-21"></a> <b>21</b> But the children rebelled against Me. They did not walk in My statutes or carefully observe My ordinances&#x2014;though the man who does these things will live by them&#x2014;and they profaned My Sabbaths. So I resolved to pour out My wrath upon them and vent My anger against them in the wilderness. 
<a id="20-22"></a> <b>22</b> But I withheld My hand and acted for the sake of My name, so that it would not be profaned in the eyes of the nations in whose sight I had brought them out.
</p>

<p>
<a id="20-23"></a> <b>23</b> However, with an uplifted hand I swore to them in the wilderness that I would scatter them among the nations and disperse them throughout the lands. 
<a id="20-24"></a> <b>24</b> For they did not practice My ordinances, but they rejected My statutes and profaned My Sabbaths, fixing their eyes on the idols of their fathers.
</p>

<p>
<a id="20-25"></a> <b>25</b> I also gave them over to statutes that were not good and ordinances by which they could not live. 
<a id="20-26"></a> <b>26</b> And I pronounced them unclean through their gifts&#x2014;the sacrifice of every firstborn in the fire&#x2014;so that I might devastate them, in order that they would know that I am the LORD.

</p>

<p>
<a id="23-1"></a> Again the word of the LORD came to me, saying,
<a id="23-2"></a> <b>2</b> “Son of man, there were two women, daughters of the same mother, 
<a id="23-3"></a> <b>3</b> and they played in Egypt, prostituting themselves from their youth. Their breasts were fondled there, and their virgin bosoms caressed. 
<a id="23-4"></a> <b>4</b> The older was named Oholah, and her sister was named Oholibah. They became Mine and gave birth to sons and daughters. As for their identities, Oholah is Samaria, and Oholibah is Jerusalem.
</p>

<p>
<a id="23-5"></a> <b>5</b> Oholah prostituted herself while she was still Mine. She lusted after her lovers, the Assyrians&#x2014;warriors 
<a id="23-6"></a> <b>6</b> clothed in blue, governors and commanders, all desirable young men, horsemen mounted on steeds. 
<a id="23-7"></a> <b>7</b> She offered sexual favors to all the elite of Assyria. She defiled herself with all the idols of those for whom she lusted.
</p>

<p>
<a id="23-8"></a> <b>8</b> She did not give up the prostitution she began in Egypt, when men slept with her in her youth, caressed her virgin bosom, and poured out their lust upon her. 
<a id="23-9"></a> <b>9</b> Therefore I delivered her into the hands of her lovers, the Assyrians for whom she lusted. 
<a id="23-10"></a> <b>10</b> They exposed her nakedness, seized her sons and daughters, and put her to the sword. Thus she became a byword among women, and they executed judgment against her.
</p>

<p>
<a id="23-11"></a> <b>11</b> Her sister Oholibah saw this, yet in her lust and prostitution she was more depraved than her sister. 
<a id="23-12"></a> <b>12</b> She too lusted after the Assyrians&#x2014;governors and commanders, warriors dressed in splendor, horsemen riding on steeds, all desirable young men. 
<a id="23-13"></a> <b>13</b> And I saw that she too had defiled herself; both of them had taken the same path.
</p>

<p>
<a id="23-14"></a> <b>14</b> But Oholibah carried her prostitution even further. She saw the men portrayed on the wall, images of the Chaldeans, engraved in vermilion, 
<a id="23-15"></a> <b>15</b> wearing belts on their waists and flowing turbans on their heads; all of them looked like officers of the Babylonians in Chaldea, the land of their birth. 
<a id="23-16"></a> <b>16</b> At the sight of them, she lusted for them and sent messengers to them in Chaldea. 
<a id="23-17"></a> <b>17</b> Then the Babylonians came to her, to the bed of love, and in their lust they defiled her. But after she had been defiled by them, she turned away in disgust.
</p>

<p>
<a id="23-18"></a> <b>18</b> When Oholibah openly prostituted herself and exposed her nakedness, I turned away from her in disgust, just as I had turned away from her sister. 
<a id="23-19"></a> <b>19</b> Yet she multiplied her promiscuity, remembering the days of her youth, when she had prostituted herself in the land of Egypt 
<a id="23-20"></a> <b>20</b> and lusted after their lovers, whose genitals were like those of donkeys and whose emission was like that of stallions. 
<a id="23-21"></a> <b>21</b> So you revisited the indecency of your youth, when the Egyptians caressed your bosom and pressed your young breasts.

<a id="23-22"></a> <b>22</b> Therefore, Oholibah, this is what the Lord GOD says: ‘I will incite your lovers against you, those from whom you turned away in disgust. And I will bring them against you from every side&#x2014; 
<a id="23-23"></a> <b>23</b> the Babylonians and all the Chaldeans, the men of Pekod, Shoa, and Koa, and all the Assyrians with them&#x2014;all desirable young men, governors and commanders, officers and men of renown, mounted on horses.
</p>

<p>
<a id="23-24"></a> <b>24</b> They will come against you with a host of peoples, with weapons, chariots, and wagons. They will array themselves against you on every side with buckler and shield and helmet. I will delegate judgment to them, and they will punish you according to their own standards. 
<a id="23-25"></a> <b>25</b> And I will set My jealous rage against you, and they will deal with you in fury. They will cut off your noses and ears, and your survivors will fall by the sword. They will seize your sons and daughters, and your remnant will be consumed by fire. 
<a id="23-26"></a> <b>26</b> They will strip off your clothes and take your fine jewelry. 
<a id="23-27"></a> <b>27</b> So I will put an end to your indecency and prostitution, which began in the land of Egypt, and you will not lift your eyes to them or remember Egypt anymore.&rsquo;
</p>

<p>
<a id="23-28"></a> <b>28</b> For this is what the Lord GOD says: ‘Surely I will deliver you into the hands of those you hate, from whom you turned away in disgust. 
<a id="23-29"></a> <b>29</b> They will treat you with hatred, take all for which you have worked, and leave you naked and bare, so that the shame of your prostitution will be exposed. Your indecency and promiscuity 
<a id="23-30"></a> <b>30</b> have brought these things upon you, because you have prostituted yourself with the nations and defiled yourself with their idols. 
<a id="23-31"></a> <b>31</b> Because you have followed the path of your sister, I will put her cup into your hand.&rsquo;
</p>

<p>
<a id="23-32"></a> <b>32</b> This is what the Lord GOD says:

<p>
‘You will drink your sister&rsquo;s cup,

It will bring scorn and derision,
</p>

<p>
for it holds so much.
</p>

<p>
<a id="23-33"></a> <b>33</b> You will be filled with drunkenness and grief,

with a cup of devastation and desolation,

</p>

<p>
<a id="23-34"></a> <b>34</b> You will drink it and drain it;

<a id="23-36"></a> <b>36</b> Then the LORD said to me: “Son of man, will you pass judgment against Oholah and Oholibah? Then declare to them their abominations. 
<a id="23-37"></a> <b>37</b> For they have committed adultery, and blood is on their hands. They have committed adultery with their idols. They have even sacrificed their children, whom they bore to Me, in the fire as food for their idols.

<p>
<a id="23-38"></a> <b>38</b> They have also done this to Me: On that very same day, they defiled My sanctuary and profaned My Sabbaths. 
<a id="23-39"></a> <b>39</b> On the very day they slaughtered their children for their idols, they entered My sanctuary to profane it. Yes, they did this inside My house.
</p>

<p>
<a id="23-40"></a> <b>40</b> Furthermore, you sisters sent messengers for men who came from afar; and behold, when they arrived, you bathed for them, painted your eyes, and adorned yourself with jewelry.

<a id="23-42"></a> <b>42</b> accompanied by the sound of a carefree crowd. Drunkards were brought in from the desert along with men from the rabble, who put bracelets on your wrists and beautiful crowns on your head.
</p>

<p>
<a id="23-43"></a> <b>43</b> Then I said of her who had grown old in adulteries: ‘Now let them use her as a prostitute, for that is all she is!&rsquo;
</p>

<p>
<a id="23-44"></a> <b>44</b> And they slept with her as with a prostitute; they slept with Oholah and Oholibah, those lewd women. 
<a id="23-45"></a> <b>45</b> But righteous men will sentence them to the punishment of those who commit adultery and bloodshed, because they are adulteresses with blood on their hands.

<a id="23-46"></a> <b>46</b> This is what the Lord GOD says: ‘Bring a mob against them and consign them to terror and plunder.

<a id="24-3"></a> <b>3</b> Now speak a parable to this rebellious house and tell them that this is what the Lord GOD says:
</p>

<p>
‘Put the pot on the fire;
</p>

<p>
put it on and pour in the water.
</p>

<p>
<a id="24-4"></a> <b>4</b> Put in the pieces of meat,

Empty it piece by piece;

<p>
<a id="24-7"></a> <b>7</b> For the blood she shed is still within her;

she poured it out on the bare rock;

she did not pour it on the ground

to cover it with dust.

I have placed her blood on the bare rock,

Then its impurity will melt within;

<p>
its rust will be consumed.

<p>
<a id="24-12"></a> <b>12</b> It has frustrated every effort;

even by the fire.

<p>
<a id="24-13"></a> <b>13</b> Because of the indecency of your uncleanness

I tried to cleanse you,

from your filthiness.
</p>

<p>
You will not be pure again
</p>

<p>
until My wrath against you has subsided.
</p>

<p>
<a id="24-14"></a> <b>14</b> I, the LORD, have spoken;

<a id="33-1"></a> Again the word of the LORD came to me, saying,
<a id="33-2"></a> <b>2</b> “Son of man, speak to your people and tell them: ‘Suppose I bring the sword against a land, and the people of that land choose a man from among them, appointing him as their watchman, 
<a id="33-3"></a> <b>3</b> and he sees the sword coming against that land and blows the ram&rsquo;s horn to warn the people.
</p>

<p>
<a id="33-4"></a> <b>4</b> Then if anyone hears the sound of the horn but fails to heed the warning, and the sword comes and takes him away, his blood will be on his own head. 
<a id="33-5"></a> <b>5</b> Since he heard the sound of the horn but failed to heed the warning, his blood will be on his own head. If he had heeded the warning, he would have saved his life.
</p>

<p>
<a id="33-6"></a> <b>6</b> But if the watchman sees the sword coming and fails to blow the horn to warn the people, and the sword comes and takes away a life, then that one will be taken away in his iniquity, but I will hold the watchman accountable for his blood.&rsquo;
</p>

<p>
<a id="33-7"></a> <b>7</b> As for you, O son of man, I have made you a watchman for the house of Israel; so hear the word from My mouth and give them the warning from Me. 
<a id="33-8"></a> <b>8</b> If I say to the wicked, ‘O wicked man, you will surely die,&rsquo; but you do not speak out to dissuade him from his way, then that wicked man will die in his iniquity, yet I will hold you accountable for his blood. 
<a id="33-9"></a> <b>9</b> But if you warn the wicked man to turn from his way, and he does not turn from it, he will die in his iniquity, but you will have saved your life.

<p>
<a id="33-10"></a> <b>10</b> Now as for you, son of man, tell the house of Israel that this is what they have said: ‘Our transgressions and our sins are heavy upon us, and we are wasting away because of them! How can we live?&rsquo;
</p>

<p>
<a id="33-11"></a> <b>11</b> Say to them: ‘As surely as I live, declares the Lord GOD, I take no pleasure in the death of the wicked, but rather that the wicked should turn from their ways and live. Turn! Turn from your evil ways! For why should you die, O house of Israel?&rsquo;
</p>

<p>
<a id="33-12"></a> <b>12</b> Therefore, son of man, say to your people: ‘The righteousness of the righteous man will not deliver him in the day of his transgression; neither will the wickedness of the wicked man cause him to stumble on the day he turns from his wickedness.

</p>

<p>
<a id="33-13"></a> <b>13</b> If I tell the righteous man that he will surely live, but he then trusts in his righteousness and commits iniquity, then none of his righteous works will be remembered; he will die because of the iniquity he has committed.
</p>

<p>
<a id="33-14"></a> <b>14</b> But if I tell the wicked man, ‘You will surely die,&rsquo; and he turns from his sin and does what is just and right&#x2014; 
<a id="33-15"></a> <b>15</b> if he restores a pledge, makes restitution for what he has stolen, and walks in the statutes of life without practicing iniquity&#x2014;then he will surely live; he will not die. 
<a id="33-16"></a> <b>16</b> None of the sins he has committed will be held against him. He has done what is just and right; he will surely live.
</p>

<p>
<a id="33-17"></a> <b>17</b> Yet your people say, ‘The way of the Lord is not just.&rsquo; But it is their way that is not just. 
<a id="33-18"></a> <b>18</b> If a righteous man turns from his righteousness and commits iniquity, he will die for it. 
<a id="33-19"></a> <b>19</b> But if a wicked man turns from his wickedness and does what is just and right, he will live because of this.

<a id="34-3"></a> <b>3</b> You eat the fat, wear the wool, and butcher the fattened sheep, but you do not feed the flock.
</p>

<p>
<a id="34-4"></a> <b>4</b> You have not strengthened the weak, healed the sick, bound up the injured, brought back the strays, or searched for the lost. Instead, you have ruled them with violence and cruelty. 
<a id="34-5"></a> <b>5</b> They were scattered for lack of a shepherd, and when they were scattered they became food for all the wild beasts. 
<a id="34-6"></a> <b>6</b> My flock went astray on all the mountains and every high hill. They were scattered over the face of all the earth, with no one to search for them or seek them out.&rsquo;

I will rescue them from all the places to which they were scattered on a day of clouds and darkness. 
<a id="34-13"></a> <b>13</b> I will bring them out from the peoples, gather them from the countries, and bring them into their own land. I will feed them on the mountains of Israel, in the ravines, and in all the settlements of the land.

<a id="37-1"></a> The hand of the LORD was upon me, and He brought me out by His Spirit and set me down in the middle of the valley, and it was full of bones. 
<a id="37-2"></a> <b>2</b> He led me all around among them, and I saw a great many bones on the floor of the valley, and indeed, they were very dry.
</p>

<p>
<a id="37-3"></a> <b>3</b> Then He asked me, “Son of man, can these bones come to life?”
</p>

<p>
“O Lord GOD,” I replied, “only You know.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="37-4"></a> <b>4</b> And He said to me, “Prophesy concerning these bones and tell them, ‘Dry bones, hear the word of the LORD! 
<a id="37-5"></a> <b>5</b> This is what the Lord GOD says to these bones: I will cause breath to enter you, and you will come to life. 
<a id="37-6"></a> <b>6</b> I will attach tendons to you and make flesh grow upon you and cover you with skin. I will put breath within you so that you will come to life. Then you will know that I am the LORD.&rsquo; ”
</p>

<p>
<a id="37-7"></a> <b>7</b> So I prophesied as I had been commanded. And as I prophesied, there was suddenly a noise, a rattling, and the bones came together, bone to bone. 
<a id="37-8"></a> <b>8</b> As I looked on, tendons appeared on them, flesh grew, and skin covered them; but there was no breath in them.
</p>

<p>
<a id="37-9"></a> <b>9</b> Then He said to me, “Prophesy to the breath; prophesy, son of man, and tell the breath that this is what the Lord GOD says: Come from the four winds, O breath, and breathe into these slain, so that they may live!”
</p>

<p>
<a id="37-10"></a> <b>10</b> So I prophesied as He had commanded me, and the breath entered them, and they came to life and stood on their feet&#x2014;a vast army.
</p>

<p>
<a id="37-11"></a> <b>11</b> Then He said to me, “Son of man, these bones are the whole house of Israel. Look, they are saying, ‘Our bones are dried up, and our hope has perished; we are cut off.&rsquo;

<p>
<a id="38-1"></a> And the word of the LORD came to me, saying,
<a id="38-2"></a> <b>2</b> “Son of man, set your face against Gog of the land of Magog, the chief prince of Meshech and Tubal. Prophesy against him 
<a id="38-3"></a> <b>3</b> and declare that this is what the Lord GOD says: Behold, I am against you, O Gog, chief prince of Meshech and Tubal. 
<a id="38-4"></a> <b>4</b> I will turn you around, put hooks in your jaws, and bring you out with all your army&#x2014;your horses, your horsemen in full armor, and a great company armed with shields and bucklers, all brandishing their swords.

<p>
<a id="38-7"></a> <b>7</b> Get ready; prepare yourself, you and all your company gathered around you; you will be their guard. 
<a id="38-8"></a> <b>8</b> After a long time you will be summoned. In the latter years you will enter a land that has recovered from war, whose people were gathered from many nations to the mountains of Israel, which had long been desolate. They had been brought out from the nations, and all now dwell securely. 
<a id="38-9"></a> <b>9</b> You and all your troops, and many peoples with you will go up, advancing like a thunderstorm; you will be like a cloud covering the land.

<p>
<a id="38-10"></a> <b>10</b> This is what the Lord GOD says: On that day, thoughts will arise in your mind, and you will devise an evil plan.

<a id="38-12"></a> <b>12</b> in order to seize the spoil and carry off the plunder, to turn a hand against the desolate places now inhabited and against a people gathered from the nations, who have acquired livestock and possessions and who live at the center of the land.&rsquo;
</p>

<p>
<a id="38-13"></a> <b>13</b> Sheba and Dedan and the merchants of Tarshish with all its villages will ask, ‘Have you come to capture the plunder? Have you assembled your hordes to carry away loot, to make off with silver and gold, to take cattle and goods, to seize great spoil?&rsquo;
</p>

<p>
<a id="38-14"></a> <b>14</b> Therefore prophesy, son of man, and tell Gog that this is what the Lord GOD says: On that day when My people Israel are dwelling securely, will you not take notice of this? 
<a id="38-15"></a> <b>15</b> And you will come from your place out of the far north&#x2014;you and many peoples with you, all riding horses&#x2014;a mighty horde, a huge army. 
<a id="38-16"></a> <b>16</b> You will advance against My people Israel like a cloud covering the land. It will happen in the latter days, O Gog, that I will bring you against My land, so that the nations may know Me when I show Myself holy in you before their eyes.
</p>

<p>
<a id="38-17"></a> <b>17</b> This is what the Lord GOD says: Are you the one of whom I have spoken in former days through My servants, the prophets of Israel, who in those times prophesied for years that I would bring you against them?

<a id="38-20"></a> <b>20</b> The fish of the sea, the birds of the air, the beasts of the field, every creature that crawls upon the ground, and all mankind on the face of the earth will tremble at My presence. The mountains will be thrown down, the cliffs will collapse, and every wall will fall to the ground.
</p>

<p>
<a id="38-21"></a> <b>21</b> And I will summon a sword against Gog on all My mountains, declares the Lord GOD, and every man&rsquo;s sword will be against his brother. 
<a id="38-22"></a> <b>22</b> I will execute judgment upon him with plague and bloodshed. I will pour out torrents of rain, hailstones, fire, and sulfur on him and on his troops and on the many nations with him.

<p>

<a id="41-7"></a> <b>7</b> The side rooms surrounding the temple widened at each successive level, because the structure surrounding the temple ascended by stages corresponding to the narrowing of the temple wall as it rose upward.

<a id="42-4"></a> <b>4</b> In front of the chambers was an inner walkway ten cubits wide and a hundred cubits long. Their doors were on the north.
</p>

<p>
<a id="42-5"></a> <b>5</b> Now the upper chambers were smaller because the galleries took more space from the chambers on the lower and middle floors of the building. 
<a id="42-6"></a> <b>6</b> For they were arranged in three stories, and unlike the courts, they had no pillars. So the upper chambers were set back further than the lower and middle floors. 
<a id="42-7"></a> <b>7</b> An outer wall in front of the chambers was fifty cubits long and ran parallel to the chambers and the outer court. 
<a id="42-8"></a> <b>8</b> For the chambers on the outer court were fifty cubits long, while those facing the temple were a hundred cubits long. 
<a id="42-9"></a> <b>9</b> And below these chambers was the entrance on the east side as one enters them from the outer court.

<a id="42-12"></a> <b>12</b> And corresponding to the doors of the chambers that were facing south, there was a door in front of the walkway that was parallel to the wall extending eastward.

<p>
<a id="42-13"></a> <b>13</b> Then the man said to me, “The north and south chambers facing the temple courtyard are the holy chambers where the priests who approach the LORD will eat the most holy offerings.

<a id="42-14"></a> <b>14</b> Once the priests have entered the holy area, they must not go out into the outer court until they have left behind the garments in which they minister, for these are holy. They are to put on other clothes before they approach the places that are for the people.”

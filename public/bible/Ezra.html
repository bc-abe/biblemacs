<a id="1-1"></a> In the first year of Cyrus king of Persia, to fulfill the word of the LORD spoken through Jeremiah, the LORD stirred the spirit of Cyrus king of Persia to send a proclamation throughout his kingdom and to put it in writing as follows:
</p>

<p>
<a id="1-2"></a> <b>2</b> “This is what Cyrus king of Persia says:
</p>

<p>
‘The LORD, the God of heaven, who has given me all the kingdoms of the earth, has appointed me to build a house for Him at Jerusalem in Judah.
</p>

<p>
<a id="1-3"></a> <b>3</b> Whoever among you belongs to His people, may his God be with him, and may he go to Jerusalem in Judah and build the house of the LORD, the God of Israel; He is the God who is in Jerusalem. 
<a id="1-4"></a> <b>4</b> And let every survivor, wherever he lives, be assisted by the men of that region with silver, gold, goods, and livestock, along with a freewill offering for the house of God in Jerusalem.&rsquo; ”
</p>

<p>
<a id="1-5"></a> <b>5</b> So the family heads of Judah and Benjamin, along with the priests and Levites&#x2014;everyone whose spirit God had stirred&#x2014;prepared to go up and rebuild the house of the LORD in Jerusalem.
</p>

<p>
<a id="1-6"></a> <b>6</b> And all their neighbors supported them with articles of silver and gold, with goods and livestock, and with valuables, in addition to all their freewill offerings.

<p>
<a id="4-23"></a> <b>23</b> When the text of the letter from King Artaxerxes was read to Rehum, Shimshai the scribe, and their associates, they went immediately to the Jews in Jerusalem and forcibly stopped them.

<a id="5-6"></a> <b>6</b> This is the text of the letter that Tattenai the governor of the region west of the Euphrates, Shethar-bozenai, and their associates, the officials in the region, sent to King Darius. 
<a id="5-7"></a> <b>7</b> The report they sent him read as follows:

<p>
To King Darius:
</p>

<p>
All peace.
</p>

<p>
<a id="5-8"></a> <b>8</b> Let it be known to the king that we went into the province of Judah, to the house of the great God. The people are rebuilding it with large stones, and placing timbers in the walls. This work is being carried out diligently and is prospering in their hands.
</p>

<p>
<a id="5-9"></a> <b>9</b> So we questioned the elders and asked, “Who authorized you to rebuild this temple and restore this structure?”
</p>

<p>
<a id="5-10"></a> <b>10</b> We also asked for their names, so that we could write down the names of their leaders for your information.
</p>

<p>
<a id="5-11"></a> <b>11</b> And this is the answer they returned:
</p>

<p>
“We are servants of the God of heaven and earth, and we are rebuilding the temple that was built many years ago, which a great king of Israel built and completed. 
<a id="5-12"></a> <b>12</b> But since our fathers angered the God of heaven, He delivered them into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, the Chaldean who destroyed this temple and carried away the people to Babylon.
</p>

<p>
<a id="5-13"></a> <b>13</b> In his first year, however, Cyrus king of Babylon issued a decree to rebuild this house of God. 
<a id="5-14"></a> <b>14</b> He also removed from the temple of Babylon the gold and silver articles belonging to the house of God, which Nebuchadnezzar had taken and carried there from the temple in Jerusalem. King Cyrus gave these articles to a man named Sheshbazzar, whom he appointed governor 
<a id="5-15"></a> <b>15</b> and instructed, ‘Take these articles, put them in the temple in Jerusalem, and let the house of God be rebuilt on its original site.&rsquo;
</p>

<p>
<a id="5-16"></a> <b>16</b> So this Sheshbazzar came and laid the foundation of the house of God in Jerusalem, and from that time until now it has been under construction, but it has not yet been completed.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="5-17"></a> <b>17</b> Now, therefore, if it pleases the king, let a search be made of the royal archives in Babylon to see if King Cyrus did indeed issue a decree to rebuild the house of God in Jerusalem. Then let the king send us his decision in this matter.

<a id="6-1"></a> Thus King Darius ordered a search of the archives stored in the treasury of Babylon. 
<a id="6-2"></a> <b>2</b> And a scroll was found in the fortress of Ecbatana, in the province of Media, with the following written on it:
</p>

<p>
Memorandum:
</p>

<p>
<a id="6-3"></a> <b>3</b> In the first year of King Cyrus, he issued a decree concerning the house of God in Jerusalem:
</p>

<p>
Let the house be rebuilt as a place for offering sacrifices, and let its foundations be firmly laid. It is to be sixty cubits high and sixty cubits wide, 
<a id="6-4"></a> <b>4</b> with three layers of cut stones and one of timbers. The costs are to be paid from the royal treasury.
</p>

<p>
<a id="6-5"></a> <b>5</b> Furthermore, the gold and silver articles of the house of God, which Nebuchadnezzar took from the temple in Jerusalem and carried to Babylon, must also be returned to the temple in Jerusalem and deposited in the house of God.
</p>

<p>
<a id="6-6"></a> <b>6</b> Therefore Darius decreed:
</p>

<p>
To Tattenai governor of the region west of the Euphrates, Shethar-bozenai, and your associates and officials in the region:
</p>

<p>
You must stay away from that place! 
<a id="6-7"></a> <b>7</b> Leave this work on the house of God alone. Let the governor and elders of the Jews rebuild this house of God on its original site.
</p>

<p>
<a id="6-8"></a> <b>8</b> I hereby decree what you must do for these elders of the Jews who are rebuilding this house of God:
</p>

<p>
The cost is to be paid in full to these men from the royal treasury out of the taxes of the provinces west of the Euphrates, so that the work will not be hindered. 
<a id="6-9"></a> <b>9</b> Whatever is needed&#x2014;young bulls, rams, and lambs for burnt offerings to the God of heaven, as well as wheat, salt, wine, and oil, as requested by the priests in Jerusalem&#x2014;must be given to them daily without fail. 
<a id="6-10"></a> <b>10</b> Then they will be able to offer sacrifices of a sweet aroma to the God of heaven and to pray for the lives of the king and his sons.
</p>

<p>
<a id="6-11"></a> <b>11</b> I also decree that if any man interferes with this directive, a beam is to be torn from his house and raised up, and he is to be impaled on it. And his own house shall be made a pile of rubble for this offense. 
<a id="6-12"></a> <b>12</b> May God, who has caused His Name to dwell there, overthrow any king or people who lifts a hand to alter this decree or to destroy this house of God in Jerusalem.

<a id="9-1"></a> After these things had been accomplished, the leaders approached me and said, “The people of Israel, including the priests and Levites, have not kept themselves separate from the surrounding peoples whose abominations are like those of the Canaanites, Hittites, Perizzites, Jebusites, Ammonites, Moabites, Egyptians, and Amorites. 
<a id="9-2"></a> <b>2</b> Indeed, the Israelites have taken some of their daughters as wives for themselves and their sons, so that the holy seed has been mixed with the people of the land. And the leaders and officials have taken the lead in this unfaithfulness!”
</p>

<p>
<a id="9-3"></a> <b>3</b> When I heard this report, I tore my tunic and cloak, pulled out some hair from my head and beard, and sat down in horror.
</p>

<p>
<a id="9-4"></a> <b>4</b> Then everyone who trembled at the words of the God of Israel gathered around me because of the unfaithfulness of the exiles, while I sat there in horror until the evening offering.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org6397fa5">
<p>
<a id="9-5"></a> <b>5</b> At the evening offering, I got up from my humiliation with my tunic and cloak torn, and I fell on my knees, spread out my hands to the LORD my God, 
<a id="9-6"></a> <b>6</b> and said:
</p>

<p>
“O my God, I am ashamed and embarrassed to lift up my face to You, my God, because our iniquities are higher than our heads, and our guilt has reached the heavens. 
<a id="9-7"></a> <b>7</b> From the days of our fathers to this day, our guilt has been great. Because of our iniquities, we and our kings and priests have been delivered into the hands of the kings of the earth and put to the sword and captivity, to pillage and humiliation, as we are this day.
</p>

<p>
<a id="9-8"></a> <b>8</b> But now, for a brief moment, grace has come from the LORD our God to preserve for us a remnant and to give us a stake in His holy place. Even in our bondage, our God has given us new life and light to our eyes. 
<a id="9-9"></a> <b>9</b> Though we are slaves, our God has not forsaken us in our bondage, but He has extended to us grace in the sight of the kings of Persia, giving us new life to rebuild the house of our God and repair its ruins, and giving us a wall of protection in Judah and Jerusalem.
</p>

<p>
<a id="9-10"></a> <b>10</b> And now, our God, what can we say after this? For we have forsaken the commandments 
<a id="9-11"></a> <b>11</b> that You gave through Your servants the prophets, saying: ‘The land that you are entering to possess is a land polluted by the impurity of its peoples and the abominations with which they have filled it from end to end. 
<a id="9-12"></a> <b>12</b> Now, therefore, do not give your daughters in marriage to their sons or take their daughters for your sons. Never seek their peace or prosperity, so that you may be strong and may eat the good things of the land, leaving it as an inheritance to your sons forever.&rsquo;
</p>

<p>
<a id="9-13"></a> <b>13</b> After all that has come upon us because of our evil deeds and our great guilt (though You, our God, have punished us less than our iniquities deserve and have given us such a remnant as this), 
<a id="9-14"></a> <b>14</b> shall we again break Your commandments and intermarry with the peoples who commit these abominations? Would You not become so angry with us as to wipe us out, leaving no remnant or survivor?
</p>

<p>
<a id="9-15"></a> <b>15</b> O LORD, God of Israel, You are righteous! For we remain this day as a remnant. Here we are before You in our guilt, though because of it no one can stand before You.”

<p>
<a id="10-1"></a> While Ezra prayed and made this confession, weeping and falling facedown before the house of God, a very large assembly of Israelites&#x2014;men, women, and children&#x2014;gathered around him, and the people wept bitterly as well.
</p>

<p>
<a id="10-2"></a> <b>2</b> Then Shecaniah son of Jehiel, an Elamite, said to Ezra: “We have been unfaithful to our God by marrying foreign women from the people of the land, yet in spite of this, there is hope for Israel. 
<a id="10-3"></a> <b>3</b> So now let us make a covenant before our God to send away all the foreign wives and their children, according to the counsel of my lord and of those who tremble at the command of our God. Let it be done according to the Law. 
<a id="10-4"></a> <b>4</b> Get up, for this matter is your responsibility, and we will support you. Be strong and take action!”
</p>

<p>
<a id="10-5"></a> <b>5</b> So Ezra got up and made the leading priests, Levites, and all Israel take an oath to do what had been said. And they took the oath.

<a id="10-6"></a> <b>6</b> Then Ezra withdrew from before the house of God and walked to the chamber of Jehohanan son of Eliashib. And while he stayed there, he ate no food and drank no water, because he was mourning over the unfaithfulness of the exiles.
</p>

<p>
<a id="10-7"></a> <b>7</b> And a proclamation was issued throughout Judah and Jerusalem that all the exiles should gather at Jerusalem. 
<a id="10-8"></a> <b>8</b> Whoever failed to appear within three days would forfeit all his property, according to the counsel of the leaders and elders, and would himself be expelled from the assembly of the exiles.
</p>

<p>
<a id="10-9"></a> <b>9</b> So within the three days, all the men of Judah and Benjamin assembled in Jerusalem, and on the twentieth day of the ninth month, all the people sat in the square at the house of God, trembling regarding this matter and because of the heavy rain.
</p>

<p>
<a id="10-10"></a> <b>10</b> Then Ezra the priest stood up and said to them, “You have been unfaithful by marrying foreign women, adding to the guilt of Israel. 
<a id="10-11"></a> <b>11</b> Now, therefore, make a confession to the LORD, the God of your fathers, and do His will. Separate yourselves from the people of the land and from your foreign wives.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="10-12"></a> <b>12</b> And the whole assembly responded in a loud voice: “Truly we must do as you say! 
<a id="10-13"></a> <b>13</b> But there are many people here, and it is the rainy season. We are not able to stay out in the open. Nor is this the work of one or two days, for we have transgressed greatly in this matter. 
<a id="10-14"></a> <b>14</b> Let our leaders represent the whole assembly. Then let everyone in our towns who has married a foreign woman come at an appointed time, together with the elders and judges of each town, until the fierce anger of our God in this matter is turned away from us.”
</p>

<p>
15(Only Jonathan son of Asahel and Jahzeiah son of Tikvah, supported by Meshullam and Shabbethai the Levite, opposed this plan.)
</p>

<p>
<a id="10-16"></a> <b>16</b> So the exiles did as proposed. Ezra the priest selected men who were family heads, each of them identified by name, to represent their families. On the first day of the tenth month they launched the investigation, 
<a id="10-17"></a> <b>17</b> and by the first day of the first month they had dealt with all the men who had married foreign women.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org38ce9b0">
<p>
<a id="2-4"></a> <b>4</b> This is the account of the heavens and the earth when they were created, in the day that the LORD God made them.
</p>

<p>
<a id="2-5"></a> <b>5</b> Now no shrub of the field had yet appeared on the earth, nor had any plant of the field sprouted; for the LORD God had not yet sent rain upon the earth, and there was no man to cultivate the ground. 
<a id="2-6"></a> <b>6</b> But springs welled up from the earth and watered the whole surface of the ground.
</p>

<p>
<a id="2-7"></a> <b>7</b> Then the LORD God formed man from the dust of the ground and breathed the breath of life into his nostrils, and the man became a living being.
</p>

<p>
<a id="2-8"></a> <b>8</b> And the LORD God planted a garden in Eden, in the east, where He placed the man He had formed. 
<a id="2-9"></a> <b>9</b> Out of the ground the LORD God gave growth to every tree that is pleasing to the eye and good for food. And in the middle of the garden were the tree of life and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.
</p>

<p>
<a id="2-10"></a> <b>10</b> Now a river flowed out of Eden to water the garden, and from there it branched into four headwaters:
</p>

<p>
<a id="2-11"></a> <b>11</b> The name of the first river is Pishon; it winds through the whole land of Havilah, where there is gold. 
<a id="2-12"></a> <b>12</b> And the gold of that land is pure, and bdellium and onyx are found there.
</p>

<p>
<a id="2-13"></a> <b>13</b> The name of the second river is Gihon; it winds through the whole land of Cush.
</p>

<p>
<a id="2-14"></a> <b>14</b> The name of the third river is Hiddekel; it runs along the east side of Assyria.
And the fourth river is the Euphrates.
</p>

<p>
<a id="2-15"></a> <b>15</b> Then the LORD God took the man and placed him in the Garden of Eden to cultivate and keep it.
</p>

<p>
<a id="2-16"></a> <b>16</b> And the LORD God commanded him, “You may eat freely from every tree of the garden, 
<a id="2-17"></a> <b>17</b> but you must not eat from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil; for in the day that you eat of it, you will surely die.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="2-18"></a> <b>18</b> The LORD God also said, “It is not good for the man to be alone. I will make for him a suitable helper.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="2-19"></a> <b>19</b> And out of the ground the LORD God formed every beast of the field and every bird of the air, and He brought them to the man to see what he would name each one. And whatever the man called each living creature, that was its name. 
<a id="2-20"></a> <b>20</b> The man gave names to all the livestock, to the birds of the air, and to every beast of the field. But for Adam no suitable helper was found.
</p>

<p>
<a id="2-21"></a> <b>21</b> So the LORD God caused the man to fall into a deep sleep, and while he slept, He took one of the man&rsquo;s ribs and closed up the area with flesh. 
<a id="2-22"></a> <b>22</b> And from the rib that the LORD God had taken from the man, He made a woman and brought her to him. 
<a id="2-23"></a> <b>23</b> And the man said:
“This is now bone of my bones
and flesh of my flesh;
she shall be called ‘woman,&rsquo;
for out of man she was taken.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="2-24"></a> <b>24</b> For this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be united to his wife, and they will become one flesh.

<p>
<a id="3-6"></a> <b>6</b> When the woman saw that the tree was good for food and pleasing to the eyes, and that it was desirable for obtaining wisdom, she took the fruit and ate it. She also gave some to her husband who was with her, and he ate it.

<a id="14-17"></a> <b>17</b> After Abram returned from defeating Chedorlaomer and the kings allied with him, the king of Sodom went out to meet him in the Valley of Shaveh (that is, the King&rsquo;s Valley).
</p>

<p>
<a id="14-18"></a> <b>18</b> Then Melchizedek king of Salem brought out bread and wine&#x2014;since he was priest of God Most High &#x2014;

<p>
<a id="14-20"></a> <b>20</b> and blessed be God Most High,
who has delivered your enemies into your hand.”
Then Abram gave Melchizedek a tenth of everything.

<p>
<a id="14-21"></a> <b>21</b> The king of Sodom said to Abram, “Give me the people, but take the goods for yourself.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="14-22"></a> <b>22</b> But Abram replied to the king of Sodom, “I have raised my hand to the LORD God Most High, Creator of heaven and earth,

“Do not be afraid, Abram.
I am your shield,

<p>
<a id="15-2"></a> <b>2</b> But Abram replied, “O Lord GOD, what can You give me, since I remain childless, and the heir of my house is Eliezer of Damascus?” 
<a id="15-3"></a> <b>3</b> Abram continued, “Behold, You have given me no offspring, so a servant in my household will be my heir.”

<a id="16-1"></a> Now Abram&rsquo;s wife Sarai had borne him no children, but she had an Egyptian maidservant named Hagar. 
<a id="16-2"></a> <b>2</b> So Sarai said to Abram, “Look now, the LORD has prevented me from bearing children. Please go to my maidservant; perhaps I can build a family by her.”
And Abram listened to the voice of Sarai. 
<a id="16-3"></a> <b>3</b> So after he had lived in Canaan for ten years, his wife Sarai took her Egyptian maidservant Hagar and gave her to Abram to be his wife. 
<a id="16-4"></a> <b>4</b> And he slept with Hagar, and she conceived. But when Hagar realized that she was pregnant, she began to despise her mistress.
</p>

<p>
<a id="16-5"></a> <b>5</b> Then Sarai said to Abram, “May the wrong done to me be upon you! I delivered my servant into your arms, and ever since she saw that she was pregnant, she has treated me with contempt. May the LORD judge between you and me.”
<a id="16-6"></a> <b>6</b> “Here,” said Abram, “your servant is in your hands. Do whatever you want with her.” Then Sarai treated Hagar so harshly that she fled from her.
</p>

<p>
<a id="16-7"></a> <b>7</b> Now the angel of the LORD found Hagar by a spring of water in the desert&#x2014;the spring along the road to Shur.
<a id="16-8"></a> <b>8</b> “Hagar, servant of Sarai,” he said, “where have you come from, and where are you going?”
“I am running away from my mistress Sarai,” she replied.
</p>

<p>
<a id="16-9"></a> <b>9</b> So the angel of the LORD told her, “Return to your mistress and submit to her authority.” 
<a id="16-10"></a> <b>10</b> Then the angel added, “I will greatly multiply your offspring so that they will be too numerous to count.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="16-11"></a> <b>11</b> The angel of the LORD proceeded:
“Behold, you have conceived and will bear a son.
And you shall name him Ishmael,
for the LORD has heard your cry of affliction.
</p>

<p>
<a id="16-12"></a> <b>12</b> He will be a wild donkey of a man,
and his hand will be against everyone,
and everyone&rsquo;s hand against him;
he will live in hostility
toward all his brothers.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="16-13"></a> <b>13</b> So Hagar gave this name to the LORD who had spoken to her: “You are the God who sees me,” for she said, “Here I have seen the One who sees me!” 
<a id="16-14"></a> <b>14</b> Therefore the well was called Beer-lahai-roi. It is located between Kadesh and Bered.
</p>

<p>
<a id="16-15"></a> <b>15</b> And Hagar bore Abram a son, and Abram gave the name Ishmael to the son she had borne.

<p>
<a id="17-14"></a> <b>14</b> But if any male is not circumcised, he will be cut off from his people; he has broken My covenant.”

<a id="17-16"></a> <b>16</b> And I will bless her and will surely give you a son by her. I will bless her, and she will be the mother of nations; kings of peoples will descend from her.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="17-17"></a> <b>17</b> Abraham fell facedown. Then he laughed and said to himself, “Can a child be born to a man who is a hundred years old? Can Sarah give birth at the age of ninety?” 
<a id="17-18"></a> <b>18</b> And Abraham said to God, “O that Ishmael might live under Your blessing!”
</p>

<p>
<a id="17-19"></a> <b>19</b> But God replied, “Your wife Sarah will indeed bear you a son, and you are to name him Isaac. I will establish My covenant with him as an everlasting covenant for his descendants after him. 
<a id="17-20"></a> <b>20</b> As for Ishmael, I have heard you, and I will surely bless him; I will make him fruitful and multiply him greatly. He will become the father of twelve rulers, and I will make him into a great nation. 
<a id="17-21"></a> <b>21</b> But I will establish My covenant with Isaac, whom Sarah will bear to you at this time next year.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="17-22"></a> <b>22</b> When He had finished speaking with Abraham, God went up from him.
</p>

<p>
<a id="17-23"></a> <b>23</b> On that very day Abraham took his son Ishmael and all those born in his household or purchased with his money&#x2014;every male among the members of Abraham&rsquo;s household&#x2014;and he circumcised them, just as God had told him.

<p>

“Yes,” they replied, “you may do as you have said.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="18-6"></a> <b>6</b> So Abraham hurried into the tent and said to Sarah, “Quick! Prepare three seahs of fine flour, knead it, and bake some bread.”

<p>
<a id="18-7"></a> <b>7</b> Meanwhile, Abraham ran to the herd, selected a tender and choice calf, and gave it to a servant, who hurried to prepare it.

<a id="18-11"></a> <b>11</b> And Abraham and Sarah were already old and well along in years; Sarah had passed the age of childbearing. 
<a id="18-12"></a> <b>12</b> So she laughed to herself, saying, “After I am worn out and my master is old, will I now have this pleasure?”

<p>
<a id="18-13"></a> <b>13</b> And the LORD asked Abraham, “Why did Sarah laugh and say, ‘Can I really bear a child when I am old?&rsquo;

“No,” they answered, “we will spend the night in the square.”

<p>
<a id="20-1"></a> Now Abraham journeyed from there to the region of the Negev and settled between Kadesh and Shur. While he was staying in Gerar, 
<a id="20-2"></a> <b>2</b> Abraham said of his wife Sarah, “She is my sister.” So Abimelech king of Gerar had Sarah brought to him.
</p>

<p>
<a id="20-3"></a> <b>3</b> One night, however, God came to Abimelech in a dream and told him, “You are as good as dead because of the woman you have taken, for she is a married woman.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="20-4"></a> <b>4</b> Now Abimelech had not gone near her, so he replied, “Lord, would You destroy a nation even though it is innocent? 
<a id="20-5"></a> <b>5</b> Didn&rsquo;t Abraham tell me, ‘She is my sister&rsquo;? And she herself said, ‘He is my brother.&rsquo; I have done this in the integrity of my heart and the innocence of my hands.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="20-6"></a> <b>6</b> Then God said to Abimelech in the dream, “Yes, I know that you did this with a clear conscience, and so I have kept you from sinning against Me. That is why I did not let you touch her. 
<a id="20-7"></a> <b>7</b> Now return the man&rsquo;s wife, for he is a prophet; he will pray for you and you will live. But if you do not restore her, be aware that you will surely die&#x2014;you and all who belong to you.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="20-8"></a> <b>8</b> Early the next morning Abimelech got up and summoned all his servants; and when he described to them all that had happened, the men were terrified.
</p>

<p>
<a id="20-9"></a> <b>9</b> Then Abimelech called Abraham and asked, “What have you done to us? How have I sinned against you, that you have brought such tremendous guilt upon me and my kingdom? You have done things to me that should not be done.” 
<a id="20-10"></a> <b>10</b> Abimelech also asked Abraham, “What prompted you to do such a thing?”
</p>

<p>
<a id="20-11"></a> <b>11</b> Abraham replied, “I thought to myself, ‘Surely there is no fear of God in this place. They will kill me on account of my wife.&rsquo; 
<a id="20-12"></a> <b>12</b> Besides, she really is my sister, the daughter of my father&#x2014;though not the daughter of my mother&#x2014;and she became my wife. 
<a id="20-13"></a> <b>13</b> So when God had me journey from my father&rsquo;s house, I said to Sarah, ‘This is how you can show your loyalty to me: Wherever we go, say of me, “He is my brother.” &rsquo; ”
</p>

<p>
<a id="20-14"></a> <b>14</b> So Abimelech brought sheep and cattle, menservants and maidservants, and he gave them to Abraham and restored his wife Sarah to him. 
<a id="20-15"></a> <b>15</b> And Abimelech said, “Look, my land is before you. Settle wherever you please.” 
<a id="20-16"></a> <b>16</b> And he said to Sarah, “See, I am giving your brother a thousand pieces of silver. It is your vindication before all who are with you; you are completely cleared.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="20-17"></a> <b>17</b> Then Abraham prayed to God, and God healed Abimelech and his wife and his maidservants, so that they could again bear children&#x2014; 
<a id="20-18"></a> <b>18</b> for on account of Abraham&rsquo;s wife Sarah, the LORD had completely closed all the wombs in Abimelech&rsquo;s household.

<p>
<a id="21-11"></a> <b>11</b> Now this matter distressed Abraham greatly because it concerned his son Ishmael.

<a id="21-13"></a> <b>13</b> But I will also make a nation of the slave woman&rsquo;s son, because he is your offspring.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="21-14"></a> <b>14</b> Early in the morning, Abraham got up, took bread and a skin of water, put them on Hagar&rsquo;s shoulders, and sent her away with the boy. She left and wandered in the Wilderness of Beersheba. 
<a id="21-15"></a> <b>15</b> When the water in the skin was gone, she left the boy under one of the bushes. 
<a id="21-16"></a> <b>16</b> Then she went off and sat down nearby, about a bowshot away, for she said, “I cannot bear to watch the boy die!” And as she sat nearby, she lifted up her voice and wept.

<p>
<a id="21-17"></a> <b>17</b> Then God heard the voice of the boy, and the angel of God called to Hagar from heaven, “What is wrong, Hagar? Do not be afraid, for God has heard the voice of the boy where he lies.

<a id="21-19"></a> <b>19</b> Then God opened her eyes, and she saw a well of water. So she went and filled the skin with water and gave the boy a drink.

<a id="24-8"></a> <b>8</b> And if the woman is unwilling to follow you, then you are released from this oath of mine. Only do not take my son back there.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="24-9"></a> <b>9</b> So the servant placed his hand under the thigh of his master Abraham and swore an oath to him concerning this matter.
</p>

<p>
<a id="24-10"></a> <b>10</b> Then the servant took ten of his master&rsquo;s camels and departed with all manner of good things from his master in hand. And he set out for Nahor&rsquo;s hometown in Aram-naharaim. 
<a id="24-11"></a> <b>11</b> As evening approached, he made the camels kneel down near the well outside the town at the time when the women went out to draw water.
<a id="24-12"></a> <b>12</b> “O LORD, God of my master Abraham,” he prayed, “please grant me success today, and show kindness to my master Abraham. 
<a id="24-13"></a> <b>13</b> Here I am, standing beside the spring, and the daughters of the townspeople are coming out to draw water. 
<a id="24-14"></a> <b>14</b> Now may it happen that the girl to whom I say, ‘Please let down your jar that I may drink,&rsquo; and who responds, ‘Drink, and I will water your camels as well&rsquo;&#x2014;let her be the one You have appointed for Your servant Isaac.

<h3 id="org23bdcea">Rebekah Is Chosen</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org23bdcea">
<p>
<a id="24-15"></a> <b>15</b> Before the servant had finished praying, Rebekah came out with her jar on her shoulder. She was the daughter of Bethuel son of Milcah, the wife of Abraham&rsquo;s brother Nahor. 
<a id="24-16"></a> <b>16</b> Now the girl was very beautiful, a virgin who had not had relations with any man. She went down to the spring, filled her jar, and came up again.
</p>

<p>
<a id="24-17"></a> <b>17</b> So the servant ran to meet her and said, “Please let me have a little water from your jar.”
<a id="24-18"></a> <b>18</b> “Drink, my lord,” she replied, and she quickly lowered her jar to her hands and gave him a drink.
</p>

<p>
<a id="24-19"></a> <b>19</b> After she had given him a drink, she said, “I will also draw water for your camels, until they have had enough to drink.” 
<a id="24-20"></a> <b>20</b> And she quickly emptied her jar into the trough and ran back to the well to draw water, until she had drawn water for all his camels.
</p>

<p>
<a id="24-21"></a> <b>21</b> Meanwhile, the man watched her silently to see whether or not the LORD had made his journey a success.
</p>

<p>
<a id="24-22"></a> <b>22</b> And after the camels had finished drinking, he took out a gold ring weighing a beka, and two gold bracelets for her wrists weighing ten shekels.
<a id="24-23"></a> <b>23</b> “Whose daughter are you?” he asked. “Please tell me, is there room in your father&rsquo;s house for us to spend the night?”
</p>

<p>
<a id="24-24"></a> <b>24</b> She replied, “I am the daughter of Bethuel, the son that Milcah bore to Nahor.” 
<a id="24-25"></a> <b>25</b> Then she added, “We have plenty of straw and feed, as well as a place for you to spend the night.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="24-26"></a> <b>26</b> Then the man bowed down and worshiped the LORD, 
<a id="24-27"></a> <b>27</b> saying, “Blessed be the LORD, the God of my master Abraham, who has not withheld His kindness and faithfulness from my master. As for me, the LORD has led me on the journey to the house of my master&rsquo;s relatives.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="24-28"></a> <b>28</b> The girl ran and told her mother&rsquo;s household about these things. 
<a id="24-29"></a> <b>29</b> Now Rebekah had a brother named Laban, and he rushed out to the man at the spring. 
<a id="24-30"></a> <b>30</b> As soon as he saw the ring, and the bracelets on his sister&rsquo;s wrists, and heard Rebekah&rsquo;s words, “The man said this to me,” he went and found the man standing by the camels near the spring.
<a id="24-31"></a> <b>31</b> “Come, you who are blessed by the LORD,” said Laban. “Why are you standing out here? I have prepared the house and a place for the camels.” 
<a id="24-32"></a> <b>32</b> So the man came to the house, and the camels were unloaded. Straw and feed were brought to the camels, and water to wash his feet and the feet of his companions.
</p>

<p>
<a id="24-33"></a> <b>33</b> Then a meal was set before the man, but he said, “I will not eat until I have told you what I came to say.”
So Laban said, “Please speak.”
<a id="24-34"></a> <b>34</b> “I am Abraham&rsquo;s servant,” he replied.
<a id="24-35"></a> <b>35</b> “The LORD has greatly blessed my master, and he has become rich. He has given him sheep and cattle, silver and gold, menservants and maidservants, camels and donkeys. 
<a id="24-36"></a> <b>36</b> My master&rsquo;s wife Sarah has borne him a son in her old age, and my master has given him everything he owns.
</p>

<p>
<a id="24-37"></a> <b>37</b> My master made me swear an oath and said, ‘You shall not take a wife for my son from the daughters of the Canaanites in whose land I dwell, 
<a id="24-38"></a> <b>38</b> but you shall go to my father&rsquo;s house and to my kindred to take a wife for my son.&rsquo;
</p>

<p>
<a id="24-39"></a> <b>39</b> Then I asked my master, ‘What if the woman will not come back with me?&rsquo;
</p>

<p>
<a id="24-40"></a> <b>40</b> And he told me, ‘The LORD, before whom I have walked, will send His angel with you and make your journey a success, so that you may take a wife for my son from my kindred and from my father&rsquo;s house. 
<a id="24-41"></a> <b>41</b> And when you go to my kindred, if they refuse to give her to you, then you will be released from my oath.&rsquo;
</p>

<p>
<a id="24-42"></a> <b>42</b> So when I came to the spring today, I prayed: O LORD, God of my master Abraham, if only You would make my journey a success! 
<a id="24-43"></a> <b>43</b> Here I am, standing beside this spring. Now if a maiden comes out to draw water and I say to her, ‘Please let me drink a little water from your jar,&rsquo; 
<a id="24-44"></a> <b>44</b> and she replies, ‘Drink, and I will draw water for your camels as well,&rsquo; may she be the woman the LORD has appointed for my master&rsquo;s son.
</p>

<p>
<a id="24-45"></a> <b>45</b> And before I had finished praying in my heart, there was Rebekah coming out with her jar on her shoulder, and she went down to the spring and drew water. So I said to her, ‘Please give me a drink.&rsquo;
</p>

<p>
<a id="24-46"></a> <b>46</b> She quickly lowered her jar from her shoulder and said, ‘Drink, and I will water your camels as well.&rsquo; So I drank, and she also watered the camels.
</p>

<p>
<a id="24-47"></a> <b>47</b> Then I asked her, ‘Whose daughter are you?&rsquo;
She replied, ‘The daughter of Bethuel son of Nahor, whom Milcah bore to him.&rsquo; So I put the ring on her nose and the bracelets on her wrists. 
<a id="24-48"></a> <b>48</b> Then I bowed down and worshiped the LORD; and I blessed the LORD, the God of my master Abraham, who led me on the right road to take the granddaughter of my master&rsquo;s brother for his son.
</p>

<p>
<a id="24-49"></a> <b>49</b> Now if you will show kindness and faithfulness to my master, tell me; but if not, let me know, so that I may go elsewhere.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="24-50"></a> <b>50</b> Laban and Bethuel answered, “This is from the LORD; we have no choice in the matter. 
<a id="24-51"></a> <b>51</b> Rebekah is here before you. Take her and go, and let her become the wife of your master&rsquo;s son, just as the LORD has decreed.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="24-52"></a> <b>52</b> When Abraham&rsquo;s servant heard their words, he bowed down to the ground before the LORD. 
<a id="24-53"></a> <b>53</b> Then he brought out jewels of silver and gold, and articles of clothing, and he gave them to Rebekah. He also gave precious gifts to her brother and her mother. 
<a id="24-54"></a> <b>54</b> Then he and the men with him ate and drank and spent the night there.
When they got up the next morning, he said, “Send me on my way to my master.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="24-55"></a> <b>55</b> But her brother and mother said, “Let the girl remain with us ten days or so. After that, she may go.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="24-56"></a> <b>56</b> But he replied, “Do not delay me, since the LORD has made my journey a success. Send me on my way so that I may go to my master.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="24-57"></a> <b>57</b> So they said, “We will call the girl and ask her opinion.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="24-58"></a> <b>58</b> They called Rebekah and asked her, “Will you go with this man?”
“I will go,” she replied.
</p>

<p>
<a id="24-59"></a> <b>59</b> So they sent their sister Rebekah on her way, along with her nurse and Abraham&rsquo;s servant and his men. 
<a id="24-60"></a> <b>60</b> And they blessed Rebekah and said to her,
“Our sister, may you become the mother
of thousands upon thousands.
May your offspring possess
the gates of their enemies.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="24-61"></a> <b>61</b> Then Rebekah and her servant girls got ready, mounted the camels, and followed the man. So the servant took Rebekah and left.

<a id="24-63"></a> <b>63</b> Early in the evening, Isaac went out to the field to meditate, and looking up, he saw the camels approaching.
</p>

<p>
<a id="24-64"></a> <b>64</b> And when Rebekah looked up and saw Isaac, she got down from her camel 
<a id="24-65"></a> <b>65</b> and asked the servant, “Who is that man in the field coming to meet us?”
“It is my master,” the servant answered. So she took her veil and covered herself. 
<a id="24-66"></a> <b>66</b> Then the servant told Isaac all that he had done.

<a id="27-1"></a> When Isaac was old and his eyes were so weak that he could no longer see, he called his older son Esau and said to him, “My son.”
“Here I am,” Esau replied.
<a id="27-2"></a> <b>2</b> “Look,” said Isaac, “I am now old, and I do not know the day of my death. 
<a id="27-3"></a> <b>3</b> Take your weapons&#x2014;your quiver and bow&#x2014;and go out into the field to hunt some game for me. 
<a id="27-4"></a> <b>4</b> Then prepare a tasty dish that I love and bring it to me to eat, so that I may bless you before I die.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="27-5"></a> <b>5</b> Now Rebekah was listening to what Isaac told his son Esau. So when Esau went into the field to hunt game and bring it back, 
<a id="27-6"></a> <b>6</b> Rebekah said to her son Jacob, “Behold, I overheard your father saying to your brother Esau, 7‘Bring me some game and prepare me a tasty dish to eat, so that I may bless you in the presence of the LORD before I die.&rsquo;
</p>

<p>
<a id="27-8"></a> <b>8</b> Now, my son, listen to my voice and do exactly as I tell you. 
<a id="27-9"></a> <b>9</b> Go out to the flock and bring me two choice young goats, so that I can make them into a tasty dish for your father&#x2014;the kind he loves. 
<a id="27-10"></a> <b>10</b> Then take it to your father to eat, so that he may bless you before he dies.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="27-11"></a> <b>11</b> Jacob answered his mother Rebekah, “Look, my brother Esau is a hairy man, but I am smooth-skinned. 
<a id="27-12"></a> <b>12</b> What if my father touches me? Then I would be revealed to him as a deceiver, and I would bring upon myself a curse rather than a blessing.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="27-13"></a> <b>13</b> His mother replied, “Your curse be on me, my son. Just obey my voice and go get them for me.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="27-14"></a> <b>14</b> So Jacob went and got two goats and brought them to his mother, who made the tasty food his father loved. 
<a id="27-15"></a> <b>15</b> And Rebekah took the finest clothes in the house that belonged to her older son Esau, and she put them on her younger son Jacob. 
<a id="27-16"></a> <b>16</b> She also put the skins of the young goats on his hands and on the smooth part of his neck. 
<a id="27-17"></a> <b>17</b> Then she handed her son Jacob the tasty food and bread she had made.
</p>

<p>
<a id="27-18"></a> <b>18</b> So Jacob went to his father and said, “My father.”
“Here I am!” he answered. “Which one are you, my son?”
</p>

<p>
<a id="27-19"></a> <b>19</b> Jacob said to his father, “I am Esau, your firstborn. I have done as you told me. Please sit up and eat some of my game, so that you may bless me.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="27-20"></a> <b>20</b> But Isaac asked his son, “How did you ever find it so quickly, my son?”
“Because the LORD your God brought it to me,” he replied.
</p>

<p>
<a id="27-21"></a> <b>21</b> Then Isaac said to Jacob, “Please come closer so I can touch you, my son. Are you really my son Esau, or not?”
</p>

<p>
<a id="27-22"></a> <b>22</b> So Jacob came close to his father Isaac, who touched him and said, “The voice is the voice of Jacob, but the hands are the hands of Esau.” 
<a id="27-23"></a> <b>23</b> Isaac did not recognize him, because his hands were hairy like those of his brother Esau; so he blessed him.
</p>

<p>
<a id="27-24"></a> <b>24</b> Again he asked, “Are you really my son Esau?”
And he replied, “I am.”
<a id="27-25"></a> <b>25</b> “Serve me,” said Isaac, “and let me eat some of my son&rsquo;s game, so that I may bless you.”
Jacob brought it to him, and he ate; then he brought him wine, and he drank.
</p>

<p>
<a id="27-26"></a> <b>26</b> Then his father Isaac said to him, “Please come near and kiss me, my son.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="27-27"></a> <b>27</b> So he came near and kissed him. When Isaac smelled his clothing, he blessed him and said:
“Ah, the smell of my son
is like the smell of a field
that the LORD has blessed.
</p>

<p>
<a id="27-28"></a> <b>28</b> May God give to you the dew of heaven
and the richness of the earth&#x2014;
an abundance of grain and new wine.
</p>

<p>
<a id="27-29"></a> <b>29</b> May peoples serve you
and nations bow down to you.
May you be the master of your brothers,
and may the sons of your mother bow down to you.
May those who curse you be cursed,
and those who bless you be blessed.”

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org1b78244">
<p>
<a id="27-30"></a> <b>30</b> As soon as Isaac had finished blessing him and Jacob had left his father&rsquo;s presence, his brother Esau returned from the hunt. 
<a id="27-31"></a> <b>31</b> He too made some tasty food, brought it to his father, and said to him, “My father, sit up and eat of your son&rsquo;s game, so that you may bless me.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="27-32"></a> <b>32</b> But his father Isaac replied, “Who are you?”
“I am Esau, your firstborn son,” he answered.
</p>

<p>
<a id="27-33"></a> <b>33</b> Isaac began to tremble violently and said, “Who was it, then, who hunted the game and brought it to me? Before you came in, I ate it all and blessed him&#x2014;and indeed, he will be blessed!”
</p>

<p>
<a id="27-34"></a> <b>34</b> When Esau heard his father&rsquo;s words, he let out a loud and bitter cry and said to his father, “Bless me too, O my father!”
</p>

<p>
<a id="27-35"></a> <b>35</b> But Isaac replied, “Your brother came deceitfully and took your blessing.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="27-36"></a> <b>36</b> So Esau declared, “Is he not rightly named Jacob? For he has cheated me twice. He took my birthright, and now he has taken my blessing.” Then he asked, “Haven&rsquo;t you saved a blessing for me?”
</p>

<p>
<a id="27-37"></a> <b>37</b> But Isaac answered Esau: “Look, I have made him your master and given him all his relatives as servants; I have sustained him with grain and new wine. What is left that I can do for you, my son?”
</p>

<p>
<a id="27-38"></a> <b>38</b> Esau said to his father, “Do you have only one blessing, my father? Bless me too, O my father!” Then Esau wept aloud.
</p>

<p>
<a id="27-39"></a> <b>39</b> His father Isaac answered him:
“Behold, your dwelling place shall be
away from the richness of the land,
away from the dew of heaven above.
</p>

<p>
<a id="27-40"></a> <b>40</b> You shall live by the sword
and serve your brother.
But when you rebel,
you will tear his yoke from your neck.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="27-41"></a> <b>41</b> Esau held a grudge against Jacob because of the blessing his father had given him. And Esau said in his heart, “The days of mourning for my father are at hand; then I will kill my brother Jacob.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="27-42"></a> <b>42</b> When the words of her older son Esau were relayed to Rebekah, she sent for her younger son Jacob and told him, “Look, your brother Esau is consoling himself by plotting to kill you. 
<a id="27-43"></a> <b>43</b> So now, my son, obey my voice and flee at once to my brother Laban in Haran. 
<a id="27-44"></a> <b>44</b> Stay with him for a while, until your brother&rsquo;s fury subsides&#x2014; 
<a id="27-45"></a> <b>45</b> until your brother&rsquo;s rage against you wanes and he forgets what you have done to him. Then I will send for you and bring you back from there. Why should I lose both of you in one day?”
</p>

<p>
<a id="27-46"></a> <b>46</b> Then Rebekah said to Isaac, “I am weary of my life because of these Hittite women. If Jacob takes a Hittite wife from among them, what good is my life?”

<a id="28-1"></a> So Isaac called for Jacob and blessed him. “Do not take a wife from the Canaanite women,” he commanded.
<a id="28-2"></a> <b>2</b> “Go at once to Paddan-aram, to the house of your mother&rsquo;s father Bethuel, and take a wife from among the daughters of Laban, your mother&rsquo;s brother.

<a id="28-11"></a> <b>11</b> On reaching a certain place, he spent the night there because the sun had set. And taking one of the stones from that place, he put it under his head and lay down to sleep.
</p>

<p>
<a id="28-12"></a> <b>12</b> And Jacob had a dream about a ladder that rested on the earth with its top reaching up to heaven, and God&rsquo;s angels were going up and down the ladder. 
<a id="28-13"></a> <b>13</b> And there at the top the LORD was standing and saying, “I am the LORD, the God of your father Abraham and the God of Isaac. I will give you and your descendants the land on which you now lie.

<a id="29-3"></a> <b>3</b> When all the flocks had been gathered there, the shepherds would roll away the stone from the mouth of the well and water the sheep. Then they would return the stone to its place over the mouth of the well.
<a id="29-4"></a> <b>4</b> “My brothers,” Jacob asked the shepherds, “where are you from?”
“We are from Haran,” they answered.
<a id="29-5"></a> <b>5</b> “Do you know Laban the grandson of Nahor?” Jacob asked.
“We know him,” they replied.
<a id="29-6"></a> <b>6</b> “Is he well?” Jacob inquired.
“Yes,” they answered, “and here comes his daughter Rachel with his sheep.”
<a id="29-7"></a> <b>7</b> “Look,” said Jacob, “it is still broad daylight; it is not yet time to gather the livestock. Water the sheep and take them back to pasture.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="29-8"></a> <b>8</b> But they replied, “We cannot, until all the flocks have been gathered and the stone has been rolled away from the mouth of the well. Then we will water the sheep.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="29-9"></a> <b>9</b> While he was still speaking with them, Rachel arrived with her father&rsquo;s sheep, for she was a shepherdess. 
<a id="29-10"></a> <b>10</b> As soon as Jacob saw Rachel, the daughter of his mother&rsquo;s brother Laban, with Laban&rsquo;s sheep, he went up and rolled the stone away from the mouth of the well and watered his uncle&rsquo;s sheep. 
<a id="29-11"></a> <b>11</b> Then Jacob kissed Rachel and wept aloud. 
<a id="29-12"></a> <b>12</b> He told Rachel that he was Rebekah&rsquo;s son, a relative of her father, and she ran and told her father.
</p>

<p>
<a id="29-13"></a> <b>13</b> When Laban heard the news about his sister&rsquo;s son Jacob, he ran out to meet him. He embraced him and kissed him and brought him to his home, where Jacob told him all that had happened.

After Jacob had stayed with him a month,

</p>

<p>
<a id="29-16"></a> <b>16</b> Now Laban had two daughters; the older was named Leah, and the younger was named Rachel. 
<a id="29-17"></a> <b>17</b> Leah had weak eyes, but Rachel was shapely and beautiful. 
<a id="29-18"></a> <b>18</b> Since Jacob loved Rachel, he answered, “I will serve you seven years for your younger daughter Rachel.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="29-19"></a> <b>19</b> Laban replied, “Better that I give her to you than to another. Stay here with me.” 
<a id="29-20"></a> <b>20</b> So Jacob served seven years for Rachel, yet it seemed but a few days because of his love for her.
</p>

<p>
<a id="29-21"></a> <b>21</b> Finally Jacob said to Laban, “Grant me my wife, for my time is complete, and I want to sleep with her.”

<p>
<a id="29-22"></a> <b>22</b> So Laban invited all the men of that place and prepared a feast. 
<a id="29-23"></a> <b>23</b> But when evening came, Laban took his daughter Leah and gave her to Jacob, and he slept with her. 
<a id="29-24"></a> <b>24</b> And Laban gave his servant girl Zilpah to his daughter Leah as her maidservant.

<p>
<a id="29-25"></a> <b>25</b> When morning came, there was Leah! “What have you done to me?” Jacob said to Laban. “Wasn&rsquo;t it for Rachel that I served you? Why have you deceived me?”
</p>

<p>
<a id="29-26"></a> <b>26</b> Laban replied, “It is not our custom here to give the younger daughter in marriage before the older. 
<a id="29-27"></a> <b>27</b> Finish this week&rsquo;s celebration, and we will give you the younger one in return for another seven years of work.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="29-28"></a> <b>28</b> And Jacob did just that. He finished the week&rsquo;s celebration, and Laban gave him his daughter Rachel as his wife. 
<a id="29-29"></a> <b>29</b> Laban also gave his servant girl Bilhah to his daughter Rachel as her maidservant.

<a id="30-19"></a> <b>19</b> Again Leah conceived and bore a sixth son to Jacob.
<a id="30-20"></a> <b>20</b> “God has given me a good gift,” she said. “This time my husband will honor me, because I have borne him six sons.” And she named him Zebulun.

<p>
<a id="30-21"></a> <b>21</b> After that, Leah gave birth to a daughter and named her Dinah.

<p>
<a id="30-22"></a> <b>22</b> Then God remembered Rachel. He listened to her and opened her womb, 
<a id="30-23"></a> <b>23</b> and she conceived and gave birth to a son. “God has taken away my shame,” she said. 
<a id="30-24"></a> <b>24</b> She named him Joseph, and said, “May the LORD add to me another son.”

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org225ab84">
<p>
<a id="30-25"></a> <b>25</b> Now after Rachel had given birth to Joseph, Jacob said to Laban, “Send me on my way so I can return to my homeland. 
<a id="30-26"></a> <b>26</b> Give me my wives and children for whom I have served you, that I may go on my way. You know how hard I have worked for you.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="30-27"></a> <b>27</b> But Laban replied, “If I have found favor in your eyes, please stay. I have learned by divination that the LORD has blessed me because of you.” 
<a id="30-28"></a> <b>28</b> And he added, “Name your wages, and I will pay them.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="30-29"></a> <b>29</b> Then Jacob answered, “You know how I have served you and how your livestock have thrived under my care. 
<a id="30-30"></a> <b>30</b> Indeed, you had very little before my arrival, but now your wealth has increased many times over. The LORD has blessed you wherever I set foot. But now, when may I also provide for my own household?”
<a id="30-31"></a> <b>31</b> “What can I give you?” Laban asked.
“You do not need to give me anything,” Jacob replied. “If you do this one thing for me, I will keep on shepherding and keeping your flocks. 
<a id="30-32"></a> <b>32</b> Let me go through all your flocks today and remove from them every speckled or spotted sheep, every dark-colored lamb, and every spotted or speckled goat. These will be my wages. 
<a id="30-33"></a> <b>33</b> So my honesty will testify for me when you come to check on my wages in the future. If I have any goats that are not speckled or spotted, or any lambs that are not dark-colored, they will be considered stolen.”
<a id="30-34"></a> <b>34</b> “Agreed,” said Laban. “Let it be as you have said.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="30-35"></a> <b>35</b> That very day Laban removed all the streaked or spotted male goats and every speckled or spotted female goat&#x2014;every one that had any white on it&#x2014;and every dark-colored lamb, and he placed them under the care of his sons. 
<a id="30-36"></a> <b>36</b> Then he put a three-day journey between himself and Jacob, while Jacob was shepherding the rest of Laban&rsquo;s flocks.
</p>

<p>
<a id="30-37"></a> <b>37</b> Jacob, however, took fresh branches of poplar, almond, and plane trees, and peeled the bark, exposing the white inner wood of the branches. 
<a id="30-38"></a> <b>38</b> Then he set the peeled branches in the watering troughs in front of the flocks coming in to drink. So when the flocks were in heat and came to drink, 
<a id="30-39"></a> <b>39</b> they mated in front of the branches. And they bore young that were streaked or speckled or spotted. 
<a id="30-40"></a> <b>40</b> Jacob set apart the young, but made the rest face the streaked dark-colored sheep in Laban&rsquo;s flocks. Then he set his own stock apart and did not put them with Laban&rsquo;s animals.
</p>

<p>
<a id="30-41"></a> <b>41</b> Whenever the stronger females of the flock were in heat, Jacob would place the branches in the troughs, in full view of the animals, so that they would breed in front of the branches. 
<a id="30-42"></a> <b>42</b> But if the animals were weak, he did not set out the branches. So the weaker animals went to Laban and the stronger ones to Jacob.
</p>

<p>
<a id="30-43"></a> <b>43</b> Thus Jacob became exceedingly prosperous. He owned large flocks, maidservants and menservants, and camels and donkeys.

</p>

<p>
<a id="31-1"></a> Now Jacob heard that Laban&rsquo;s sons were saying, “Jacob has taken away all that belonged to our father and built all this wealth at our father&rsquo;s expense.” 
<a id="31-2"></a> <b>2</b> And Jacob saw from the countenance of Laban that his attitude toward him had changed.
</p>

<p>
<a id="31-3"></a> <b>3</b> Then the LORD said to Jacob, “Go back to the land of your fathers and to your kindred, and I will be with you.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="31-4"></a> <b>4</b> So Jacob sent word and called Rachel and Leah to the field where his flocks were, 
<a id="31-5"></a> <b>5</b> and he told them, “I can see from your father&rsquo;s countenance that his attitude toward me has changed; but the God of my father has been with me. 
<a id="31-6"></a> <b>6</b> You know that I have served your father with all my strength. 
<a id="31-7"></a> <b>7</b> And although he has cheated me and changed my wages ten times, God has not allowed him to harm me. 
<a id="31-8"></a> <b>8</b> If he said, ‘The speckled will be your wages,&rsquo; then the whole flock bore speckled offspring. If he said, ‘The streaked will be your wages,&rsquo; then the whole flock bore streaked offspring. 
<a id="31-9"></a> <b>9</b> Thus God has taken away your father&rsquo;s livestock and given them to me.
</p>

<p>
<a id="31-10"></a> <b>10</b> When the flocks were breeding, I saw in a dream that the streaked, spotted, and speckled males were mating with the females. 
<a id="31-11"></a> <b>11</b> In that dream the angel of God said to me, ‘Jacob!&rsquo;
And I replied, ‘Here I am.&rsquo;
12‘Look up,&rsquo; he said, ‘and see that all the males that are mating with the flock are streaked, spotted, or speckled; for I have seen all that Laban has done to you. 
<a id="31-13"></a> <b>13</b> I am the God of Bethel, where you anointed the pillar and made a solemn vow to Me. Now get up and leave this land at once, and return to your native land.&rsquo; ”
</p>

<p>
<a id="31-14"></a> <b>14</b> And Rachel and Leah replied, “Do we have any portion or inheritance left in our father&rsquo;s house? 
<a id="31-15"></a> <b>15</b> Are we not regarded by him as outsiders? Not only has he sold us, but he has certainly squandered what was paid for us. 
<a id="31-16"></a> <b>16</b> Surely all the wealth that God has taken away from our father belongs to us and to our children. So do whatever God has told you.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="31-17"></a> <b>17</b> Then Jacob got up and put his children and his wives on camels, 
<a id="31-18"></a> <b>18</b> and he drove all his livestock before him, along with all the possessions he had acquired in Paddan-aram, to go to his father Isaac in the land in Canaan.
</p>

<p>
<a id="31-19"></a> <b>19</b> Now while Laban was out shearing his sheep, Rachel stole her father&rsquo;s household idols. 
<a id="31-20"></a> <b>20</b> Moreover, Jacob deceived Laban the Aramean by not telling him that he was running away. 
<a id="31-21"></a> <b>21</b> So he fled with all his possessions, crossed the Euphrates, and headed for the hill country of Gilead.

<h3 id="orgbb8bfac">Laban Pursues Jacob</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgbb8bfac">
<p>
<a id="31-22"></a> <b>22</b> On the third day Laban was informed that Jacob had fled. 
<a id="31-23"></a> <b>23</b> So he took his relatives with him, pursued Jacob for seven days, and overtook him in the hill country of Gilead. 
<a id="31-24"></a> <b>24</b> But that night God came to Laban the Aramean in a dream and warned him, “Be careful not to say anything to Jacob, either good or bad.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="31-25"></a> <b>25</b> Now Jacob had pitched his tent in the hill country of Gilead when Laban overtook him, and Laban and his relatives camped there as well. 
<a id="31-26"></a> <b>26</b> Then Laban said to Jacob, “What have you done? You have deceived me and carried off my daughters like captives of war! 
<a id="31-27"></a> <b>27</b> Why did you run away secretly and deceive me, without even telling me? I would have sent you away with joy and singing, with tambourines and harps. 
<a id="31-28"></a> <b>28</b> But you did not even let me kiss my grandchildren and my daughters goodbye. Now you have done a foolish thing.
</p>

<p>
<a id="31-29"></a> <b>29</b> I have power to do you great harm, but last night the God of your father said to me, ‘Be careful not to say anything to Jacob, either good or bad.&rsquo; 
<a id="31-30"></a> <b>30</b> Now you have gone off because you long for your father&rsquo;s house. But why have you stolen my gods?”
<a id="31-31"></a> <b>31</b> “I was afraid,” Jacob answered, “for I thought you would take your daughters from me by force. 
<a id="31-32"></a> <b>32</b> If you find your gods with anyone here, he shall not live! In the presence of our relatives, see for yourself if anything is yours, and take it back.” For Jacob did not know that Rachel had stolen the idols.
</p>

<p>
<a id="31-33"></a> <b>33</b> So Laban went into Jacob&rsquo;s tent, then Leah&rsquo;s tent, and then the tents of the two maidservants, but he found nothing. Then he left Leah&rsquo;s tent and entered Rachel&rsquo;s tent. 
<a id="31-34"></a> <b>34</b> Now Rachel had taken Laban&rsquo;s household idols, put them in the saddlebag of her camel, and was sitting on them. And Laban searched everything in the tent but found nothing.
</p>

<p>
<a id="31-35"></a> <b>35</b> Rachel said to her father, “Sir, do not be angry that I cannot stand up before you; for I am having my period.” So Laban searched, but could not find the household idols.
</p>

<p>
<a id="31-36"></a> <b>36</b> Then Jacob became incensed and challenged Laban. “What is my crime?” he said. “For what sin of mine have you so hotly pursued me? 
<a id="31-37"></a> <b>37</b> You have searched all my goods! Have you found anything that belongs to you? Put it here before my brothers and yours, that they may judge between the two of us.
</p>

<p>
<a id="31-38"></a> <b>38</b> I have been with you for twenty years now. Your sheep and goats have not miscarried, nor have I eaten the rams of your flock. 
<a id="31-39"></a> <b>39</b> I did not bring you anything torn by wild beasts; I bore the loss myself. And you demanded payment from me for what was stolen by day or night. 
<a id="31-40"></a> <b>40</b> As it was, the heat consumed me by day and the frost by night, and sleep fled from my eyes.
</p>

<p>
<a id="31-41"></a> <b>41</b> Thus for twenty years I have served in your household&#x2014;fourteen years for your two daughters and six years for your flocks&#x2014;and you have changed my wages ten times! 
<a id="31-42"></a> <b>42</b> If the God of my father, the God of Abraham and the Fear of Isaac, had not been with me, surely by now you would have sent me away empty-handed. But God has seen my affliction and the toil of my hands, and last night He rendered judgment.”

<h3 id="org2be28ac">Jacob&rsquo;s Covenant with Laban</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org2be28ac">
<p>
<a id="31-43"></a> <b>43</b> But Laban answered Jacob, “These daughters are my daughters, these sons are my sons, and these flocks are my flocks! Everything you see is mine! Yet what can I do today about these daughters of mine or the children they have borne? 
<a id="31-44"></a> <b>44</b> Come now, let us make a covenant, you and I, and let it serve as a witness between you and me.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="31-45"></a> <b>45</b> So Jacob picked out a stone and set it up as a pillar, 
<a id="31-46"></a> <b>46</b> and he said to his relatives, “Gather some stones.” So they took stones and made a mound, and there by the mound they ate. 
<a id="31-47"></a> <b>47</b> Laban called it Jegar-sahadutha, and Jacob called it Galeed.
</p>

<p>
<a id="31-48"></a> <b>48</b> Then Laban declared, “This mound is a witness between you and me this day.”
Therefore the place was called Galeed. 
<a id="31-49"></a> <b>49</b> It was also called Mizpah, because Laban said, “May the LORD keep watch between you and me when we are absent from each other. 
<a id="31-50"></a> <b>50</b> If you mistreat my daughters or take other wives, although no one is with us, remember that God is a witness between you and me.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="31-51"></a> <b>51</b> Laban also said to Jacob, “Here is the mound, and here is the pillar I have set up between you and me. 
<a id="31-52"></a> <b>52</b> This mound is a witness, and this pillar is a witness, that I will not go past this mound to harm you, and you will not go past this mound and pillar to harm me. 
<a id="31-53"></a> <b>53</b> May the God of Abraham and the God of Nahor, the God of their father, judge between us.”
So Jacob swore by the Fear of his father Isaac.
</p>

<p>
<a id="31-54"></a> <b>54</b> Then Jacob offered a sacrifice on the mountain and invited his relatives to eat a meal. And after they had eaten, they spent the night on the mountain. 
<a id="31-55"></a> <b>55</b> Early the next morning, Laban got up and kissed his grandchildren and daughters and blessed them. Then he left to return home.

<p>
<a id="32-1"></a> Jacob also went on his way, and the angels of God met him. 
<a id="32-2"></a> <b>2</b> When Jacob saw them, he said, “This is the camp of God.” So he named that place Mahanaim.
</p>

<p>
<a id="32-3"></a> <b>3</b> Jacob sent messengers ahead of him to his brother Esau in the land of Seir, the country of Edom. 
<a id="32-4"></a> <b>4</b> He instructed them, “You are to say to my master Esau, ‘Your servant Jacob says: I have been staying with Laban and have remained there until now. 
<a id="32-5"></a> <b>5</b> I have oxen, donkeys, flocks, menservants, and maidservants. I have sent this message to inform my master, so that I may find favor in your sight.&rsquo; ”
</p>

<p>
<a id="32-6"></a> <b>6</b> When the messengers returned to Jacob, they said, “We went to your brother Esau, and now he is coming to meet you&#x2014;he and four hundred men with him.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="32-7"></a> <b>7</b> In great fear and distress, Jacob divided his people into two camps, as well as the flocks and herds and camels. 
<a id="32-8"></a> <b>8</b> He thought, “If Esau comes and attacks one camp, then the other camp can escape.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="32-9"></a> <b>9</b> Then Jacob declared, “O God of my father Abraham, God of my father Isaac, the LORD who told me, ‘Go back to your country and to your kindred, and I will make you prosper,&rsquo; 
<a id="32-10"></a> <b>10</b> I am unworthy of all the kindness and faithfulness You have shown Your servant. Indeed, with only my staff I came across the Jordan, but now I have become two camps. 
<a id="32-11"></a> <b>11</b> Please deliver me from the hand of my brother Esau, for I am afraid that he may come and attack me and the mothers and children with me. 
<a id="32-12"></a> <b>12</b> But You have said, ‘I will surely make you prosper, and I will make your offspring like the sand of the sea, too numerous to count.&rsquo; ”
</p>

<p>
<a id="32-13"></a> <b>13</b> Jacob spent the night there, and from what he had brought with him, he selected a gift for his brother Esau: 14200 female goats, 20 male goats, 200 ewes, 20 rams, 1530 milk camels with their young, 40 cows, 10 bulls, 20 female donkeys, and 10 male donkeys. 
<a id="32-16"></a> <b>16</b> He entrusted them to his servants in separate herds and told them, “Go on ahead of me, and keep some distance between the herds.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="32-17"></a> <b>17</b> He instructed the one in the lead, “When my brother Esau meets you and asks, ‘To whom do you belong, where are you going, and whose animals are these before you?&rsquo; 
<a id="32-18"></a> <b>18</b> then you are to say, ‘They belong to your servant Jacob. They are a gift, sent to my lord Esau. And behold, Jacob is behind us.&rsquo; ”
</p>

<p>
<a id="32-19"></a> <b>19</b> He also instructed the second, the third, and all those following behind the herds: “When you meet Esau, you are to say the same thing to him. 
<a id="32-20"></a> <b>20</b> You are also to say, ‘Look, your servant Jacob is right behind us.&rsquo; ” For he thought, “I will appease Esau with the gift that is going before me. After that I can face him, and perhaps he will accept me.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="32-21"></a> <b>21</b> So Jacob&rsquo;s gifts went on before him, while he spent the night in the camp.

<a id="32-23"></a> <b>23</b> He took them and sent them across the stream, along with all his possessions.
</p>

<p>
<a id="32-24"></a> <b>24</b> So Jacob was left all alone, and there a man wrestled with him until daybreak. 
<a id="32-25"></a> <b>25</b> When the man saw that he could not overpower Jacob, he struck the socket of Jacob&rsquo;s hip and dislocated it as they wrestled. 
<a id="32-26"></a> <b>26</b> Then the man said, “Let me go, for it is daybreak.”
But Jacob replied, “I will not let you go unless you bless me.”
<a id="32-27"></a> <b>27</b> “What is your name?” the man asked.
“Jacob,” he replied.
</p>

<p>
<a id="32-28"></a> <b>28</b> Then the man said, “Your name will no longer be Jacob, because you have struggled with God and with men, and you have prevailed.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="32-29"></a> <b>29</b> And Jacob requested, “Please tell me your name.”
But he replied, “Why do you ask my name?” Then he blessed Jacob there.
</p>

<p>
<a id="32-30"></a> <b>30</b> So Jacob named the place Peniel, saying, “Indeed, I have seen God face to face, and yet my life was spared.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="32-31"></a> <b>31</b> The sun rose above him as he passed by Penuel, and he was limping because of his hip.

<a id="33-1"></a> Now Jacob looked up and saw Esau coming toward him with four hundred men. So he divided the children among Leah, Rachel, and the two maidservants. 
<a id="33-2"></a> <b>2</b> He put the maidservants and their children in front, Leah and her children next, and Rachel and Joseph at the rear. 
<a id="33-3"></a> <b>3</b> But Jacob himself went on ahead and bowed to the ground seven times as he approached his brother.
</p>

<p>
<a id="33-4"></a> <b>4</b> Esau, however, ran to him and embraced him, threw his arms around his neck, and kissed him. And they both wept.
</p>

<p>
<a id="33-5"></a> <b>5</b> When Esau looked up and saw the women and children, he asked, “Who are these with you?”
Jacob answered, “These are the children God has graciously given your servant.” 
<a id="33-6"></a> <b>6</b> Then the maidservants and their children approached and bowed down. 
<a id="33-7"></a> <b>7</b> Leah and her children also approached and bowed down, and then Joseph and Rachel approached and bowed down.
<a id="33-8"></a> <b>8</b> “What do you mean by sending this whole company to meet me?” asked Esau.
“To find favor in your sight, my lord,” Jacob answered.
<a id="33-9"></a> <b>9</b> “I already have plenty, my brother,” Esau replied. “Keep what belongs to you.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="33-10"></a> <b>10</b> But Jacob insisted, “No, please! If I have found favor in your sight, then receive this gift from my hand. For indeed, I have seen your face, and it is like seeing the face of God, since you have received me favorably. 
<a id="33-11"></a> <b>11</b> Please accept my gift that was brought to you, because God has been gracious to me and I have all I need.” So Jacob pressed him until he accepted.
</p>

<p>
<a id="33-12"></a> <b>12</b> Then Esau said, “Let us be on our way, and I will go ahead of you.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="33-13"></a> <b>13</b> But Jacob replied, “My lord knows that the children are frail, and I must care for sheep and cattle that are nursing their young. If they are driven hard for even a day, all the animals will die. 
<a id="33-14"></a> <b>14</b> Please let my lord go ahead of his servant. I will continue on slowly, at a comfortable pace for the livestock and children, until I come to my lord at Seir.”
<a id="33-15"></a> <b>15</b> “Let me leave some of my people with you,” Esau said.
But Jacob replied, “Why do that? Let me find favor in the sight of my lord.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="33-16"></a> <b>16</b> So that day Esau started on his way back to Seir,

<p>
<a id="34-1"></a> Now Dinah, the daughter Leah had borne to Jacob, went out to visit the daughters of the land. 
<a id="34-2"></a> <b>2</b> When Shechem son of Hamor the Hivite, the prince of the region, saw her, he took her and lay with her by force. 
<a id="34-3"></a> <b>3</b> And his soul was drawn to Dinah, the daughter of Jacob. He loved the young girl and spoke to her tenderly. 
<a id="34-4"></a> <b>4</b> So Shechem told his father Hamor, “Get me this girl as a wife.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="34-5"></a> <b>5</b> Jacob heard that Shechem had defiled his daughter Dinah, but since his sons were with his livestock in the field, he remained silent about it until they returned. 
<a id="34-6"></a> <b>6</b> Meanwhile, Shechem&rsquo;s father Hamor came to speak with Jacob. 
<a id="34-7"></a> <b>7</b> When Jacob&rsquo;s sons heard what had happened, they returned from the field. They were filled with grief and fury, because Shechem had committed an outrage in Israel by lying with Jacob&rsquo;s daughter&#x2014;a thing that should not be done.
</p>

<p>
<a id="34-8"></a> <b>8</b> But Hamor said to them, “My son Shechem longs for your daughter. Please give her to him as his wife. 
<a id="34-9"></a> <b>9</b> Intermarry with us; give us your daughters, and take our daughters for yourselves. 
<a id="34-10"></a> <b>10</b> You may settle among us, and the land will be open to you. Live here, move about freely, and acquire your own property.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="34-11"></a> <b>11</b> Then Shechem said to Dinah&rsquo;s father and brothers, “Grant me this favor, and I will give you whatever you ask. 
<a id="34-12"></a> <b>12</b> Demand a high dowry and an expensive gift, and I will give you whatever you ask. Only give me the girl as my wife!”

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org3bcb75b">
<p>
<a id="34-13"></a> <b>13</b> But because Shechem had defiled their sister Dinah, Jacob&rsquo;s sons answered him and his father Hamor deceitfully.
<a id="34-14"></a> <b>14</b> “We cannot do such a thing,” they said. “To give our sister to an uncircumcised man would be a disgrace to us. 
<a id="34-15"></a> <b>15</b> We will consent to this on one condition, that you become circumcised like us&#x2014;every one of your males. 
<a id="34-16"></a> <b>16</b> Then we will give you our daughters and take your daughters for ourselves. We will dwell among you and become one people. 
<a id="34-17"></a> <b>17</b> But if you will not agree to be circumcised, then we will take our sister and go.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="34-18"></a> <b>18</b> Their offer seemed good to Hamor and his son Shechem. 
<a id="34-19"></a> <b>19</b> The young man, who was the most respected of all his father&rsquo;s household, did not hesitate to fulfill this request, because he was delighted with Jacob&rsquo;s daughter.
</p>

<p>
<a id="34-20"></a> <b>20</b> So Hamor and his son Shechem went to the gate of their city and addressed the men of their city:
<a id="34-21"></a> <b>21</b> “These men are at peace with us. Let them live and trade in our land; indeed, it is large enough for them. Let us take their daughters in marriage and give our daughters to them. 
<a id="34-22"></a> <b>22</b> But only on this condition will the men agree to dwell with us and be one people: if all our men are circumcised as they are. 
<a id="34-23"></a> <b>23</b> Will not their livestock, their possessions, and all their animals become ours? Only let us consent to them, and they will dwell among us.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="34-24"></a> <b>24</b> All the men who went out of the city gate listened to Hamor and his son Shechem, and every male of the city was circumcised.
</p>

<p>
<a id="34-25"></a> <b>25</b> Three days later, while they were still in pain, two of Jacob&rsquo;s sons (Dinah&rsquo;s brothers Simeon and Levi) took their swords, went into the unsuspecting city, and slaughtered every male. 
<a id="34-26"></a> <b>26</b> They killed Hamor and his son Shechem with their swords, took Dinah out of Shechem&rsquo;s house, and went away.
</p>

<p>
<a id="34-27"></a> <b>27</b> Jacob&rsquo;s other sons came upon the slaughter and looted the city, because their sister had been defiled. 
<a id="34-28"></a> <b>28</b> They took their flocks and herds and donkeys, and everything else in the city or in the field. 
<a id="34-29"></a> <b>29</b> They carried off all their possessions and women and children, and they plundered everything in their houses.
</p>

<p>
<a id="34-30"></a> <b>30</b> Then Jacob said to Simeon and Levi, “You have brought trouble upon me by making me a stench to the Canaanites and Perizzites, the people of this land. We are few in number; if they unite against me and attack me, I and my household will be destroyed.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="34-31"></a> <b>31</b> But they replied, “Should he have treated our sister like a prostitute?”

<p>
<a id="35-1"></a> Then God said to Jacob, “Arise, go up to Bethel, and settle there. Build an altar there to the God who appeared to you when you fled from your brother Esau.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="35-2"></a> <b>2</b> So Jacob told his household and all who were with him, “Get rid of the foreign gods that are among you. Purify yourselves and change your garments. 
<a id="35-3"></a> <b>3</b> Then let us arise and go to Bethel. I will build an altar there to God, who answered me in my day of distress. He has been with me wherever I have gone.”

<p>
<a id="35-4"></a> <b>4</b> So they gave Jacob all their foreign gods and all their earrings, and Jacob buried them under the oak near Shechem.
</p>

<p>
<a id="35-5"></a> <b>5</b> As they set out, a terror from God fell over the surrounding cities, so that they did not pursue Jacob&rsquo;s sons. 
<a id="35-6"></a> <b>6</b> So Jacob and everyone with him arrived in Luz (that is, Bethel) in the land of Canaan. 
<a id="35-7"></a> <b>7</b> There Jacob built an altar, and he called that place El-bethel, because it was there that God had revealed Himself to Jacob as he fled from his brother.
</p>

<p>
<a id="35-8"></a> <b>8</b> Now Deborah, Rebekah&rsquo;s nurse, died and was buried under the oak below Bethel. So Jacob named it Allon-bachuth.
</p>

<p>
<a id="35-9"></a> <b>9</b> After Jacob had returned from Paddan-aram, God appeared to him again and blessed him. 
<a id="35-10"></a> <b>10</b> And God said to him, “Though your name is Jacob, you will no longer be called Jacob. Instead, your name will be Israel.” So God named him Israel.
</p>

<p>
<a id="35-11"></a> <b>11</b> And God told him, “I am God Almighty. Be fruitful and multiply. A nation&#x2014;even a company of nations&#x2014;shall come from you, and kings shall descend from you.

</p>

<p>
<a id="35-13"></a> <b>13</b> Then God went up from the place where He had spoken with him.
</p>

<p>
<a id="35-14"></a> <b>14</b> So Jacob set up a pillar in the place where God had spoken with him&#x2014;a stone marker&#x2014;and he poured out a drink offering on it and anointed it with oil.

<a id="37-7"></a> <b>7</b> We were binding sheaves of grain in the field, and suddenly my sheaf rose and stood upright, while your sheaves gathered around and bowed down to mine.”
<a id="37-8"></a> <b>8</b> “Do you intend to reign over us?” his brothers asked. “Will you actually rule us?” So they hated him even more because of his dream and his statements.
</p>

<p>
<a id="37-9"></a> <b>9</b> Then Joseph had another dream and told it to his brothers. “Look,” he said, “I had another dream, and this time the sun and moon and eleven stars were bowing down to me.”

<a id="37-12"></a> <b>12</b> Some time later, Joseph&rsquo;s brothers had gone to pasture their father&rsquo;s flocks near Shechem. 
<a id="37-13"></a> <b>13</b> Israel said to him, “Are not your brothers pasturing the flocks at Shechem? Get ready; I am sending you to them.”
“I am ready,” Joseph replied.
</p>

<p>
<a id="37-14"></a> <b>14</b> Then Israel told him, “Go now and see how your brothers and the flocks are faring, and bring word back to me.”
So he sent him off from the Valley of Hebron. And when Joseph arrived in Shechem, 
<a id="37-15"></a> <b>15</b> a man found him wandering in the field and asked, “What are you looking for?”
<a id="37-16"></a> <b>16</b> “I am looking for my brothers,” Joseph replied. “Can you please tell me where they are pasturing their flocks?”
<a id="37-17"></a> <b>17</b> “They have moved on from here,” the man answered. “I heard them say, ‘Let us go to Dothan.&rsquo; ” So Joseph set out after his brothers and found them at Dothan.

<a id="37-22"></a> <b>22</b> “Do not shed his blood. Throw him into this pit in the wilderness, but do not lay a hand on him.” Reuben said this so that he could rescue Joseph from their hands and return him to his father.

<p>
<a id="37-25"></a> <b>25</b> And as they sat down to eat a meal, they looked up and saw a caravan of Ishmaelites coming from Gilead. Their camels were carrying spices, balm, and myrrh on their way down to Egypt.

<p>
<a id="37-26"></a> <b>26</b> Then Judah said to his brothers, “What profit will we gain if we kill our brother and cover up his blood? 
<a id="37-27"></a> <b>27</b> Come, let us sell him to the Ishmaelites and not lay a hand on him; for he is our brother, our own flesh.” And they agreed. 
<a id="37-28"></a> <b>28</b> So when the Midianite traders passed by, his brothers pulled Joseph out of the pit and sold him for twenty shekels of silver to the Ishmaelites, who took him to Egypt.
</p>

<p>
<a id="37-29"></a> <b>29</b> When Reuben returned to the pit and saw that Joseph was not there, he tore his clothes, 
<a id="37-30"></a> <b>30</b> returned to his brothers, and said, “The boy is gone! What am I going to do?”

<a id="37-32"></a> <b>32</b> They sent the robe of many colors to their father and said, “We found this. Examine it to see whether it is your son&rsquo;s robe or not.”

<p>
<a id="37-33"></a> <b>33</b> His father recognized it and said, “It is my son&rsquo;s robe! A vicious animal has devoured him. Joseph has surely been torn to pieces!”

</p>

<p>
<a id="38-1"></a> About that time, Judah left his brothers and settled near a man named Hirah, an Adullamite. 
<a id="38-2"></a> <b>2</b> There Judah saw the daughter of a Canaanite man named Shua, and he took her as a wife and slept with her. 
<a id="38-3"></a> <b>3</b> So she conceived and gave birth to a son, and Judah named him Er. 
<a id="38-4"></a> <b>4</b> Again she conceived and gave birth to a son, and she named him Onan. 
<a id="38-5"></a> <b>5</b> Then she gave birth to another son and named him Shelah; it was at Chezib that she gave birth to him.
</p>

<p>
<a id="38-6"></a> <b>6</b> Now Judah acquired a wife for Er, his firstborn, and her name was Tamar. 
<a id="38-7"></a> <b>7</b> But Er, Judah&rsquo;s firstborn, was wicked in the sight of the LORD; so the LORD put him to death. 
<a id="38-8"></a> <b>8</b> Then Judah said to Onan, “Sleep with your brother&rsquo;s wife. Perform your duty as her brother-in-law and raise up offspring for your brother.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="38-9"></a> <b>9</b> But Onan knew that the offspring would not belong to him; so whenever he would sleep with his brother&rsquo;s wife, he would spill his seed on the ground so that he would not produce offspring for his brother. 
<a id="38-10"></a> <b>10</b> What he did was wicked in the sight of the LORD, so He put Onan to death as well.
</p>

<p>
<a id="38-11"></a> <b>11</b> Then Judah said to his daughter-in-law Tamar, “Live as a widow in your father&rsquo;s house until my son Shelah grows up.” For he thought, “He may die too, like his brothers.” So Tamar went to live in her father&rsquo;s house.
</p>

<p>
<a id="38-12"></a> <b>12</b> After a long time Judah&rsquo;s wife, the daughter of Shua, died. When Judah had finished mourning, he and his friend Hirah the Adullamite went up to his sheepshearers at Timnah. 
<a id="38-13"></a> <b>13</b> When Tamar was told, “Your father-in-law is going up to Timnah to shear his sheep,” 
<a id="38-14"></a> <b>14</b> she removed her widow&rsquo;s garments, covered her face with a veil to disguise herself, and sat at the entrance to Enaim, which is on the way to Timnah. For she saw that although Shelah had grown up, she had not been given to him as a wife.
</p>

<p>
<a id="38-15"></a> <b>15</b> When Judah saw her, he thought she was a prostitute because she had covered her face. 
<a id="38-16"></a> <b>16</b> Not realizing that she was his daughter-in-law, he went over to her and said, “Come now, let me sleep with you.”
“What will you give me for sleeping with you?” she inquired.
<a id="38-17"></a> <b>17</b> “I will send you a young goat from my flock,” Judah answered.
But she replied, “Only if you leave me something as a pledge until you send it.”
<a id="38-18"></a> <b>18</b> “What pledge should I give you?” he asked.
She answered, “Your seal and your cord, and the staff in your hand.” So he gave them to her and slept with her, and she became pregnant by him. 
<a id="38-19"></a> <b>19</b> Then Tamar got up and departed. And she removed her veil and put on her widow&rsquo;s garments again.
</p>

<p>
<a id="38-20"></a> <b>20</b> Now when Judah sent his friend Hirah the Adullamite with the young goat to collect the items he had left with the woman, he could not find her. 
<a id="38-21"></a> <b>21</b> He asked the men of that place, “Where is the shrine prostitute who was beside the road at Enaim?”
“No shrine prostitute has been here,” they answered.
</p>

<p>
<a id="38-22"></a> <b>22</b> So Hirah returned to Judah and said, “I could not find her, and furthermore, the men of that place said, ‘No shrine prostitute has been here.&rsquo; ”
<a id="38-23"></a> <b>23</b> “Let her keep the items,” Judah replied. “Otherwise we will become a laughingstock. After all, I did send her this young goat, but you could not find her.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="38-24"></a> <b>24</b> About three months later, Judah was told, “Your daughter-in-law Tamar has prostituted herself, and now she is pregnant.”
“Bring her out!” Judah replied. “Let her be burned to death!”
</p>

<p>
<a id="38-25"></a> <b>25</b> As she was being brought out, Tamar sent a message to her father-in-law: “I am pregnant by the man to whom these items belong.” And she added, “Please examine them. Whose seal and cord and staff are these?”
</p>

<p>
<a id="38-26"></a> <b>26</b> Judah recognized the items and said, “She is more righteous than I, since I did not give her to my son Shelah.” And he did not have relations with her again.

<a id="38-28"></a> <b>28</b> And as she was giving birth, one of them put out his hand; so the midwife took a scarlet thread and tied it around his wrist. “This one came out first,” she announced. 
<a id="38-29"></a> <b>29</b> But when he pulled his hand back and his brother came out, she said, “You have broken out first!” So he was named Perez.

<p>
<a id="39-1"></a> Meanwhile, Joseph had been taken down to Egypt, where an Egyptian named Potiphar, an officer of Pharaoh and captain of the guard, bought him from the Ishmaelites who had taken him there. 
<a id="39-2"></a> <b>2</b> And the LORD was with Joseph, and he became a successful man, serving in the household of his Egyptian master.
</p>

<p>
<a id="39-3"></a> <b>3</b> When his master saw that the LORD was with him and made him prosper in all he did, 
<a id="39-4"></a> <b>4</b> Joseph found favor in his sight and became his personal attendant.
Potiphar put him in charge of his household and entrusted him with everything he owned. 
<a id="39-5"></a> <b>5</b> From the time that he put Joseph in charge of his household and all he owned, the LORD blessed the Egyptian&rsquo;s household on account of him. The LORD&rsquo;s blessing was on everything he owned, both in his house and in his field. 
<a id="39-6"></a> <b>6</b> So Potiphar left all that he owned in Joseph&rsquo;s care; he did not concern himself with anything except the food he ate.
Now Joseph was well-built and handsome, 
<a id="39-7"></a> <b>7</b> and after some time his master&rsquo;s wife cast her eyes upon Joseph and said, “Sleep with me.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="39-8"></a> <b>8</b> But he refused. “Look,” he said to his master&rsquo;s wife, “with me here, my master does not concern himself with anything in his house, and he has entrusted everything he owns to my care. 
<a id="39-9"></a> <b>9</b> No one in this house is greater than I am. He has withheld nothing from me except you, because you are his wife. So how could I do such a great evil and sin against God?”
</p>

<p>
<a id="39-10"></a> <b>10</b> Although Potiphar&rsquo;s wife spoke to Joseph day after day, he refused to go to bed with her or even be near her. 
<a id="39-11"></a> <b>11</b> One day, however, Joseph went into the house to attend to his work, and not a single household servant was inside. 
<a id="39-12"></a> <b>12</b> She grabbed Joseph by his cloak and said, “Sleep with me!” But leaving his cloak in her hand, he escaped and ran outside.

<a id="39-14"></a> <b>14</b> she called her household servants. “Look,” she said, “this Hebrew has been brought to us to make sport of us. He came to me so he could sleep with me, but I screamed as loud as I could. 
<a id="39-15"></a> <b>15</b> When he heard me scream for help, he left his cloak beside me and ran out of the house.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="39-16"></a> <b>16</b> So Potiphar&rsquo;s wife kept Joseph&rsquo;s cloak beside her until his master came home. 
<a id="39-17"></a> <b>17</b> Then she told him the same story: “The Hebrew slave you brought us came to me to make sport of me,

</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>
<a id="40-1"></a> Some time later, the king&rsquo;s cupbearer and baker offended their master, the king of Egypt. 
<a id="40-2"></a> <b>2</b> Pharaoh was angry with his two officers, the chief cupbearer and the chief baker, 
<a id="40-3"></a> <b>3</b> and imprisoned them in the house of the captain of the guard, the same prison where Joseph was confined. 
<a id="40-4"></a> <b>4</b> The captain of the guard assigned them to Joseph, and he became their personal attendant.
After they had been in custody for some time, 
<a id="40-5"></a> <b>5</b> both of these men&#x2014;the Egyptian king&rsquo;s cupbearer and baker, who were being held in the prison&#x2014;had a dream on the same night, and each dream had its own meaning.
</p>

<p>
<a id="40-6"></a> <b>6</b> When Joseph came to them in the morning, he saw that they were distraught. 
<a id="40-7"></a> <b>7</b> So he asked the officials of Pharaoh who were in custody with him in his master&rsquo;s house, “Why are your faces so downcast today?”
<a id="40-8"></a> <b>8</b> “We both had dreams,” they replied, “but there is no one to interpret them.”
Then Joseph said to them, “Don&rsquo;t interpretations belong to God? Tell me your dreams.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="40-9"></a> <b>9</b> So the chief cupbearer told Joseph his dream: “In my dream there was a vine before me, 
<a id="40-10"></a> <b>10</b> and on the vine were three branches. As it budded, its blossoms opened and its clusters ripened into grapes. 
<a id="40-11"></a> <b>11</b> Pharaoh&rsquo;s cup was in my hand, and I took the grapes, squeezed them into his cup, and placed the cup in his hand.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="40-12"></a> <b>12</b> Joseph replied, “This is the interpretation: The three branches are three days. 
<a id="40-13"></a> <b>13</b> Within three days Pharaoh will lift up your head and restore your position. You will put Pharaoh&rsquo;s cup in his hand, just as you did when you were his cupbearer. 
<a id="40-14"></a> <b>14</b> But when it goes well for you, please remember me and show me kindness by mentioning me to Pharaoh, that he might bring me out of this prison. 
<a id="40-15"></a> <b>15</b> For I was kidnapped from the land of the Hebrews, and even here I have done nothing for which they should have put me in this dungeon.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="40-16"></a> <b>16</b> When the chief baker saw that the interpretation was favorable, he said to Joseph, “I too had a dream: There were three baskets of white bread on my head. 
<a id="40-17"></a> <b>17</b> In the top basket were all sorts of baked goods for Pharaoh, but the birds were eating them out of the basket on my head.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="40-18"></a> <b>18</b> Joseph replied, “This is the interpretation: The three baskets are three days. 
<a id="40-19"></a> <b>19</b> Within three days Pharaoh will lift off your head and hang you on a tree. Then the birds will eat the flesh of your body.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="40-20"></a> <b>20</b> On the third day, which was Pharaoh&rsquo;s birthday, he held a feast for all his officials, and in their presence he lifted up the heads of the chief cupbearer and the chief baker. 
<a id="40-21"></a> <b>21</b> Pharaoh restored the chief cupbearer to his position, so that he once again placed the cup in Pharaoh&rsquo;s hand. 
<a id="40-22"></a> <b>22</b> But Pharaoh hanged the chief baker, just as Joseph had described to them in his interpretation.
</p>

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org6d36961">

<a id="41-5"></a> <b>5</b> but he fell back asleep and dreamed a second time: Seven heads of grain, plump and ripe, came up on one stalk. 
<a id="41-6"></a> <b>6</b> After them, seven other heads of grain sprouted, thin and scorched by the east wind. 
<a id="41-7"></a> <b>7</b> And the thin heads of grain swallowed up the seven plump, ripe ones. Then Pharaoh awoke and realized it was a dream.
</p>

<p>
<a id="41-8"></a> <b>8</b> In the morning his spirit was troubled, so he summoned all the magicians and wise men of Egypt. Pharaoh told them his dreams, but no one could interpret them for him.

<p>
<a id="41-9"></a> <b>9</b> Then the chief cupbearer said to Pharaoh, “Today I recall my failures. 
<a id="41-10"></a> <b>10</b> Pharaoh was once angry with his servants, and he put me and the chief baker in the custody of the captain of the guard. 
<a id="41-11"></a> <b>11</b> One night both the chief baker and I had dreams, and each dream had its own meaning. 
<a id="41-12"></a> <b>12</b> Now a young Hebrew was there with us, a servant of the captain of the guard. We told him our dreams and he interpreted them for us individually.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org893ba7f">
<p>
<a id="41-14"></a> <b>14</b> So Pharaoh sent for Joseph, who was quickly brought out of the dungeon. After he had shaved and changed his clothes, he went in before Pharaoh.
</p>

<p>
<a id="41-15"></a> <b>15</b> Pharaoh said to Joseph, “I had a dream, and no one can interpret it. But I have heard it said of you that when you hear a dream you can interpret it.”
<a id="41-16"></a> <b>16</b> “I myself cannot do it,” Joseph replied, “but God will give Pharaoh a sound answer.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="41-17"></a> <b>17</b> Then Pharaoh said to Joseph: “In my dream I was standing on the bank of the Nile, 
<a id="41-18"></a> <b>18</b> when seven cows, well-fed and sleek, came up from the river and began to graze among the reeds. 
<a id="41-19"></a> <b>19</b> After them, seven other cows&#x2014;sickly, ugly, and thin&#x2014;came up. I have never seen such ugly cows in all the land of Egypt! 
<a id="41-20"></a> <b>20</b> Then the thin, ugly cows devoured the seven well-fed cows that were there first. 
<a id="41-21"></a> <b>21</b> When they had devoured them, however, no one could tell that they had done so; their appearance was as ugly as it had been before. Then I awoke.
</p>

<p>
<a id="41-22"></a> <b>22</b> In my dream I also saw seven heads of grain, plump and ripe, growing on a single stalk. 
<a id="41-23"></a> <b>23</b> After them, seven other heads of grain sprouted&#x2014;withered, thin, and scorched by the east wind. 
<a id="41-24"></a> <b>24</b> And the thin heads of grain swallowed the seven plump ones.
I told this dream to the magicians, but no one could explain it to me.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="41-25"></a> <b>25</b> At this, Joseph said to Pharaoh, “The dreams of Pharaoh are one and the same. God has revealed to Pharaoh what He is about to do. 
<a id="41-26"></a> <b>26</b> The seven good cows are seven years, and the seven ripe heads of grain are seven years. The dreams have the same meaning. 
<a id="41-27"></a> <b>27</b> Moreover, the seven thin, ugly cows that came up after them are seven years, and so are the seven worthless heads of grain scorched by the east wind&#x2014;they are seven years of famine.
</p>

<p>
<a id="41-28"></a> <b>28</b> It is just as I said to Pharaoh: God has shown Pharaoh what He is about to do. 
<a id="41-29"></a> <b>29</b> Behold, seven years of great abundance are coming throughout the land of Egypt, 
<a id="41-30"></a> <b>30</b> but seven years of famine will follow them. Then all the abundance in the land of Egypt will be forgotten, and the famine will devastate the land. 
<a id="41-31"></a> <b>31</b> The abundance in the land will not be remembered, since the famine that follows it will be so severe.
</p>

<p>
<a id="41-32"></a> <b>32</b> Moreover, because the dream was given to Pharaoh in two versions, the matter has been decreed by God, and He will carry it out shortly.
</p>

<p>
<a id="41-33"></a> <b>33</b> Now, therefore, Pharaoh should look for a discerning and wise man and set him over the land of Egypt. 
<a id="41-34"></a> <b>34</b> Let Pharaoh take action and appoint commissioners over the land to take a fifth of the harvest of Egypt during the seven years of abundance. 
<a id="41-35"></a> <b>35</b> Under the authority of Pharaoh, let them collect all the excess food from these good years, that they may come and lay up the grain to be preserved as food in the cities. 
<a id="41-36"></a> <b>36</b> This food will be a reserve for the land during the seven years of famine to come upon the land of Egypt. Then the country will not perish in the famine.”

<a id="41-44"></a> <b>44</b> And Pharaoh declared to Joseph, “I am Pharaoh, but without your permission, no one in all the land of Egypt shall lift his hand or foot.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="41-45"></a> <b>45</b> Pharaoh gave Joseph the name Zaphenath-paneah, and he gave him Asenath daughter of Potiphera, priest of On, to be his wife. And Joseph took charge of all the land of Egypt.

<a id="41-46"></a> <b>46</b> Now Joseph was thirty years old when he entered the service of Pharaoh king of Egypt. And Joseph left Pharaoh&rsquo;s presence and traveled throughout the land of Egypt.

<p>
<a id="41-47"></a> <b>47</b> During the seven years of abundance, the land brought forth bountifully. 
<a id="41-48"></a> <b>48</b> During those seven years, Joseph collected all the excess food in the land of Egypt and stored it in the cities. In every city he laid up the food from the fields around it. 
<a id="41-49"></a> <b>49</b> So Joseph stored up grain in such abundance, like the sand of the sea, that he stopped keeping track of it; for it was beyond measure.
</p>

<p>
<a id="41-50"></a> <b>50</b> Before the years of famine arrived, two sons were born to Joseph by Asenath daughter of Potiphera, priest of On.

<a id="41-55"></a> <b>55</b> When extreme hunger came to all the land of Egypt and the people cried out to Pharaoh for food, he told all the Egyptians, “Go to Joseph and do whatever he tells you.”

<p>
<a id="41-56"></a> <b>56</b> When the famine had spread over all the land, Joseph opened up all the storehouses and sold grain to the Egyptians; for the famine was severe in the land of Egypt.

</p>

<p>
<a id="42-1"></a> When Jacob learned that there was grain in Egypt, he said to his sons, “Why are you staring at one another?”
<a id="42-2"></a> <b>2</b> “Look,” he added, “I have heard that there is grain in Egypt. Go down there and buy some for us, so that we may live and not die.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="42-3"></a> <b>3</b> So ten of Joseph&rsquo;s brothers went down to buy grain from Egypt. 
<a id="42-4"></a> <b>4</b> But Jacob did not send Joseph&rsquo;s brother Benjamin with his brothers, for he said, “I am afraid that harm might befall him.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="42-5"></a> <b>5</b> So the sons of Israel were among those who came to buy grain, since the famine had also spread to the land of Canaan.
</p>

<p>
<a id="42-6"></a> <b>6</b> Now Joseph was the ruler of the land; he was the one who sold grain to all its people. So when his brothers arrived, they bowed down before him with their faces to the ground. 
<a id="42-7"></a> <b>7</b> And when Joseph saw his brothers, he recognized them, but he treated them as strangers and spoke harshly to them. “Where have you come from?” he asked.
“From the land of Canaan,” they replied. “We are here to buy food.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="42-8"></a> <b>8</b> Although Joseph recognized his brothers, they did not recognize him. 
<a id="42-9"></a> <b>9</b> Joseph remembered his dreams about them and said, “You are spies! You have come to see if our land is vulnerable.”
<a id="42-10"></a> <b>10</b> “Not so, my lord,” they replied. “Your servants have come to buy food. 
<a id="42-11"></a> <b>11</b> We are all sons of one man. Your servants are honest men, not spies.”
<a id="42-12"></a> <b>12</b> “No,” he told them. “You have come to see if our land is vulnerable.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="42-13"></a> <b>13</b> But they answered, “Your servants are twelve brothers, the sons of one man in the land of Canaan. The youngest is now with our father, and one is no more.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="42-14"></a> <b>14</b> Then Joseph declared, “Just as I said, you are spies! 
<a id="42-15"></a> <b>15</b> And this is how you will be tested: As surely as Pharaoh lives, you shall not leave this place unless your youngest brother comes here. 
<a id="42-16"></a> <b>16</b> Send one of your number to get your brother; the rest of you will be confined so that the truth of your words may be tested. If they are untrue, then as surely as Pharaoh lives, you are spies!”
</p>

<p>
<a id="42-17"></a> <b>17</b> So Joseph imprisoned them for three days, 
<a id="42-18"></a> <b>18</b> and on the third day he said to them, “I fear God. So do this and you will live: 
<a id="42-19"></a> <b>19</b> If you are honest, leave one of your brothers in custody while the rest of you go and take back grain to relieve the hunger of your households. 
<a id="42-20"></a> <b>20</b> Then bring your youngest brother to me so that your words can be verified, that you may not die.”
And to this they consented.
</p>

<p>
<a id="42-21"></a> <b>21</b> Then they said to one another, “Surely we are being punished because of our brother. We saw his anguish when he pleaded with us, but we would not listen. That is why this distress has come upon us.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="42-22"></a> <b>22</b> And Reuben responded, “Didn&rsquo;t I tell you not to sin against the boy? But you would not listen. Now we must account for his blood!”
</p>

<p>
<a id="42-23"></a> <b>23</b> They did not realize that Joseph understood them, since there was an interpreter between them. 
<a id="42-24"></a> <b>24</b> And he turned away from them and wept. When he turned back and spoke to them, he took Simeon from them and had him bound before their eyes.

<a id="42-25"></a> <b>25</b> Then Joseph gave orders to fill their bags with grain, to return each man&rsquo;s silver to his sack, and to give them provisions for their journey. This order was carried out, 
<a id="42-26"></a> <b>26</b> and they loaded the grain on their donkeys and departed.
</p>

<p>
<a id="42-27"></a> <b>27</b> At the place where they lodged for the night, one of them opened his sack to get feed for his donkey, and he saw his silver in the mouth of the sack.
<a id="42-28"></a> <b>28</b> “My silver has been returned!” he said to his brothers. “It is here in my sack.”
Their hearts sank, and trembling, they turned to one another and said, “What is this that God has done to us?”
</p>

<p>
<a id="42-29"></a> <b>29</b> When they reached their father Jacob in the land of Canaan, they described to him all that had happened to them:
<a id="42-30"></a> <b>30</b> “The man who is lord of the land spoke harshly to us and accused us of spying on the country.
</p>

<p>
<a id="42-31"></a> <b>31</b> But we told him, ‘We are honest men, not spies. 
<a id="42-32"></a> <b>32</b> We are twelve brothers, sons of one father. One is no more, and the youngest is now with our father in the land of Canaan.&rsquo;
</p>

<p>
<a id="42-33"></a> <b>33</b> Then the man who is lord of the land said to us, ‘This is how I will know whether you are honest: Leave one brother with me, take food to relieve the hunger of your households, and go. 
<a id="42-34"></a> <b>34</b> But bring your youngest brother back to me so I will know that you are not spies but honest men. Then I will give your brother back to you, and you can trade in the land.&rsquo; ”
</p>

<p>
<a id="42-35"></a> <b>35</b> As they began emptying their sacks, there in each man&rsquo;s sack was his bag of silver! And when they and their father saw the bags of silver, they were dismayed.
</p>

<p>
<a id="42-36"></a> <b>36</b> Their father Jacob said to them, “You have deprived me of my sons. Joseph is gone and Simeon is no more. Now you want to take Benjamin. Everything is going against me!”
</p>

<p>
<a id="42-37"></a> <b>37</b> Then Reuben said to his father, “You may kill my two sons if I fail to bring him back to you. Put him in my care, and I will return him.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="42-38"></a> <b>38</b> But Jacob replied, “My son will not go down there with you, for his brother is dead, and he alone is left. If any harm comes to him on your journey, you will bring my gray hair down to Sheol in sorrow.”

<p>
<a id="43-1"></a> Now the famine was still severe in the land. 
<a id="43-2"></a> <b>2</b> So when Jacob&rsquo;s sons had eaten all the grain they had brought from Egypt, their father said to them, “Go back and buy us a little more food.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="43-3"></a> <b>3</b> But Judah replied, “The man solemnly warned us, ‘You will not see my face again unless your brother is with you.&rsquo; 
<a id="43-4"></a> <b>4</b> If you will send our brother with us, we will go down and buy food for you. 
<a id="43-5"></a> <b>5</b> But if you will not send him, we will not go; for the man told us, ‘You will not see my face again unless your brother is with you.&rsquo; ”
<a id="43-6"></a> <b>6</b> “Why did you bring this trouble upon me?” Israel asked. “Why did you tell the man you had another brother?”
</p>

<p>
<a id="43-7"></a> <b>7</b> They replied, “The man questioned us in detail about ourselves and our family: ‘Is your father still alive? Do you have another brother?&rsquo; And we answered him accordingly. How could we possibly know that he would say, ‘Bring your brother here&rsquo;?”
</p>

<p>
<a id="43-8"></a> <b>8</b> And Judah said to his father Israel, “Send the boy with me, and we will go at once, so that we may live and not die&#x2014;neither we, nor you, nor our children. 
<a id="43-9"></a> <b>9</b> I will guarantee his safety. You may hold me personally responsible. If I do not bring him back and set him before you, then may I bear the guilt before you all my life. 
<a id="43-10"></a> <b>10</b> If we had not delayed, we could have come and gone twice by now.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="43-11"></a> <b>11</b> Then their father Israel said to them, “If it must be so, then do this: Put some of the best products of the land in your packs and carry them down as a gift for the man&#x2014;a little balm and a little honey, spices and myrrh, pistachios and almonds. 
<a id="43-12"></a> <b>12</b> Take double the silver with you so that you may return the silver that was put back into the mouths of your sacks. Perhaps it was a mistake. 
<a id="43-13"></a> <b>13</b> Take your brother as well, and return to the man at once. 
<a id="43-14"></a> <b>14</b> May God Almighty grant you mercy before the man, that he may release your other brother along with Benjamin. As for me, if I am bereaved, I am bereaved.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="43-15"></a> <b>15</b> So the men took these gifts, along with double the amount of silver, and Benjamin as well. Then they hurried down to Egypt and stood before Joseph.

<h3 id="orgb5acddc">Joseph&rsquo;s Hospitality to His Brothers</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgb5acddc">
<p>
<a id="43-16"></a> <b>16</b> When Joseph saw Benjamin with his brothers, he said to the steward of his house, “Take these men to my house. Slaughter an animal and prepare it, for they shall dine with me at noon.” 
<a id="43-17"></a> <b>17</b> The man did as Joseph had commanded and took the brothers to Joseph&rsquo;s house.
</p>

<p>
<a id="43-18"></a> <b>18</b> But the brothers were frightened that they had been taken to Joseph&rsquo;s house. “We have been brought here because of the silver that was returned in our bags the first time,” they said. “They intend to overpower us and take us as slaves, along with our donkeys.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="43-19"></a> <b>19</b> So they approached Joseph&rsquo;s steward and spoke to him at the entrance to the house.
<a id="43-20"></a> <b>20</b> “Please, sir,” they said, “we really did come down here the first time to buy food. 
<a id="43-21"></a> <b>21</b> But when we came to the place we lodged for the night, we opened our sacks and, behold, each of us found his silver in the mouth of his sack! It was the full amount of our silver, and we have brought it back with us. 
<a id="43-22"></a> <b>22</b> We have brought additional silver with us to buy food. We do not know who put our silver in our sacks.”
<a id="43-23"></a> <b>23</b> “It is fine,” said the steward. “Do not be afraid. Your God, the God of your father, gave you the treasure that was in your sacks. I received your silver.” Then he brought Simeon out to them. 
<a id="43-24"></a> <b>24</b> And the steward took the men into Joseph&rsquo;s house, gave them water to wash their feet, and provided food for their donkeys.
</p>

<p>
<a id="43-25"></a> <b>25</b> Since the brothers had been told that they were going to eat a meal there, they prepared their gift for Joseph&rsquo;s arrival at noon. 
<a id="43-26"></a> <b>26</b> When Joseph came home, they presented him with the gifts they had brought, and they bowed to the ground before him.
</p>

<p>
<a id="43-27"></a> <b>27</b> He asked if they were well, and then he asked, “How is your elderly father you told me about? Is he still alive?”
<a id="43-28"></a> <b>28</b> “Your servant our father is well,” they answered. “He is still alive.” And they bowed down to honor him.
</p>

<p>
<a id="43-29"></a> <b>29</b> When Joseph looked up and saw his brother Benjamin, his own mother&rsquo;s son, he asked, “Is this your youngest brother, the one you told me about?” Then he declared, “May God be gracious to you, my son.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="43-30"></a> <b>30</b> Joseph hurried out because he was moved to tears for his brother, and he went to a private room to weep. 
<a id="43-31"></a> <b>31</b> Then he washed his face and came back out. Regaining his composure, he said, “Serve the meal.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="43-32"></a> <b>32</b> They separately served Joseph, his brothers, and the Egyptians. They ate separately because the Egyptians would not eat with the Hebrews, since that was detestable to them. 
<a id="43-33"></a> <b>33</b> They were seated before Joseph in order by age, from the firstborn to the youngest, and the men looked at one another in astonishment. 
<a id="43-34"></a> <b>34</b> When the portions were served to them from Joseph&rsquo;s table, Benjamin&rsquo;s portion was five times larger than any of the others. So they feasted and drank freely with Joseph.

</p>

<p>
<a id="44-1"></a> Then Joseph instructed his steward: “Fill the men&rsquo;s sacks with as much food as they can carry, and put each one&rsquo;s silver in the mouth of his sack. 
<a id="44-2"></a> <b>2</b> Put my cup, the silver one, in the mouth of the youngest one&rsquo;s sack, along with the silver for his grain.”
So the steward did as Joseph had instructed.
</p>

<p>
<a id="44-3"></a> <b>3</b> At daybreak, the men were sent on their way with their donkeys. 
<a id="44-4"></a> <b>4</b> They had not gone far from the city when Joseph told his steward, “Pursue the men at once, and when you overtake them, ask, ‘Why have you repaid good with evil? 
<a id="44-5"></a> <b>5</b> Is this not the cup my master drinks from and uses for divination? What you have done is wicked!&rsquo; ”
</p>

<p>
<a id="44-6"></a> <b>6</b> When the steward overtook them, he relayed these words to them.
<a id="44-7"></a> <b>7</b> “Why does my lord say these things?” they asked. “Your servants could not possibly do such a thing. 
<a id="44-8"></a> <b>8</b> We even brought back to you from the land of Canaan the silver we found in the mouths of our sacks. Why would we steal silver or gold from your master&rsquo;s house? 
<a id="44-9"></a> <b>9</b> If any of your servants is found to have it, he must die, and the rest will become slaves of my lord.”
<a id="44-10"></a> <b>10</b> “As you say,” replied the steward. “But only the one who is found with the cup will be my slave, and the rest of you shall be free of blame.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="44-11"></a> <b>11</b> So each one quickly lowered his sack to the ground and opened it. 
<a id="44-12"></a> <b>12</b> The steward searched, beginning with the oldest and ending with the youngest&#x2014;and the cup was found in Benjamin&rsquo;s sack. 
<a id="44-13"></a> <b>13</b> Then they all tore their clothes, loaded their donkeys, and returned to the city.
</p>

<p>
<a id="44-14"></a> <b>14</b> When Judah and his brothers arrived at Joseph&rsquo;s house, he was still there, and they fell to the ground before him.
<a id="44-15"></a> <b>15</b> “What is this deed you have done?” Joseph declared. “Do you not know that a man like me can surely divine the truth?”
<a id="44-16"></a> <b>16</b> “What can we say to my lord?” Judah replied. “How can we plead? How can we justify ourselves? God has exposed the iniquity of your servants. We are now my lord&rsquo;s slaves&#x2014;both we and the one who was found with the cup.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="44-17"></a> <b>17</b> But Joseph replied, “Far be it from me to do this. The man who was found with the cup will be my slave. The rest of you may return to your father in peace.”

<p>
<a id="44-20"></a> <b>20</b> And we answered, ‘We have an elderly father and a younger brother, the child of his old age. The boy&rsquo;s brother is dead. He is the only one of his mother&rsquo;s sons left, and his father loves him.&rsquo;

<a id="44-21"></a> <b>21</b> Then you told your servants, ‘Bring him down to me so that I can see him for myself.&rsquo;

</p>

<p>
<a id="47-5"></a> <b>5</b> Pharaoh said to Joseph, “Now that your father and brothers have come to you,

<a id="47-13"></a> <b>13</b> There was no food, however, in all that region, because the famine was so severe; the lands of Egypt and Canaan had been exhausted by the famine. 
<a id="47-14"></a> <b>14</b> Joseph collected all the money to be found in the land of Egypt and the land of Canaan in exchange for the grain they were buying, and he brought it into Pharaoh&rsquo;s palace. 
<a id="47-15"></a> <b>15</b> When the money from the lands of Egypt and Canaan was gone, all the Egyptians came to Joseph and said, “Give us food. Why should we die before your eyes? For our funds have run out!”
<a id="47-16"></a> <b>16</b> “Then bring me your livestock,” said Joseph. “Since the money is gone, I will sell you food in exchange for your livestock.” 
<a id="47-17"></a> <b>17</b> So they brought their livestock to Joseph, and he gave them food in exchange for their horses, their flocks and herds, and their donkeys. Throughout that year he provided them with food in exchange for all their livestock.
</p>

<p>
<a id="47-18"></a> <b>18</b> When that year was over, they came to him the second year and said, “We cannot hide from our lord that our money is gone and all our livestock belongs to you. There is nothing left for our lord except our bodies and our land. 
<a id="47-19"></a> <b>19</b> Why should we perish before your eyes&#x2014;we and our land as well? Purchase us and our land in exchange for food. Then we, along with our land, will be slaves to Pharaoh. Give us seed that we may live and not die, and that the land may not become desolate.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="47-20"></a> <b>20</b> So Joseph acquired for Pharaoh all the land in Egypt; the Egyptians, one and all, sold their fields because the famine was so severe upon them. The land became Pharaoh&rsquo;s, 
<a id="47-21"></a> <b>21</b> and Joseph reduced the people to servitude from one end of Egypt to the other. 
<a id="47-22"></a> <b>22</b> However, he did not acquire the priests&rsquo; portion of the land, for it had been given to them by Pharaoh. They ate the rations that Pharaoh supplied; so they did not sell their land.
</p>

<p>
<a id="47-23"></a> <b>23</b> Then Joseph said to the people, “Now that I have acquired you and your land for Pharaoh this day, here is seed for you to sow in the land. 
<a id="47-24"></a> <b>24</b> At harvest time, you are to give a fifth of it to Pharaoh, and four-fifths will be yours as seed for the field and food for yourselves and your households and children.”
<a id="47-25"></a> <b>25</b> “You have saved our lives,” they said. “We have found favor in our lord&rsquo;s eyes, and we will be Pharaoh&rsquo;s servants.” 
<a id="47-26"></a> <b>26</b> So Joseph established a law that a fifth of the produce belongs to Pharaoh, and it is in effect in the land of Egypt to this day. Only the priests&rsquo; land does not belong to Pharaoh.

<a id="48-8"></a> <b>8</b> When Israel saw the sons of Joseph, he asked, “Who are these?”

So Jacob said, “Please bring them to me, that I may bless them.”

<a id="48-10"></a> <b>10</b> Now Israel&rsquo;s eyesight was poor because of old age; he could hardly see. Joseph brought his sons to him, and his father kissed them and embraced them.

</p>

<p>
<a id="48-13"></a> <b>13</b> And Joseph took both of them&#x2014;with Ephraim in his right hand toward Israel&rsquo;s left hand, and Manasseh in his left hand toward Israel&rsquo;s right hand&#x2014;and brought them close to him. 
<a id="48-14"></a> <b>14</b> But Israel stretched out his right hand and put it on the head of Ephraim, the younger; and crossing his hands, he put his left on Manasseh&rsquo;s head, although Manasseh was the firstborn.

</p>

<p>
<a id="48-17"></a> <b>17</b> When Joseph saw that his father had placed his right hand on Ephraim&rsquo;s head, he was displeased and took his father&rsquo;s hand to move it from Ephraim&rsquo;s head to Manasseh&rsquo;s.
<a id="48-18"></a> <b>18</b> “Not so, my father!” Joseph said. “This one is the firstborn; put your right hand on his head.”

<p>
<a id="50-1"></a> Then Joseph fell upon his father&rsquo;s face, wept over him, and kissed him.
</p>

<p>
<a id="50-2"></a> <b>2</b> And Joseph directed the physicians in his service to embalm his father Israel. So they embalmed him, 
<a id="50-3"></a> <b>3</b> taking the forty days required to complete the embalming. And the Egyptians mourned for him seventy days.
</p>

<p>
<a id="50-4"></a> <b>4</b> When the days of mourning had passed, Joseph said to Pharaoh&rsquo;s court, “If I have found favor in your eyes, please tell Pharaoh that 
<a id="50-5"></a> <b>5</b> my father made me swear an oath when he said, ‘I am about to die. You must bury me in the tomb that I dug for myself in the land of Canaan.&rsquo; Now let me go and bury my father, and then return.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="50-6"></a> <b>6</b> Pharaoh replied, “Go up and bury your father, as he made you swear to do.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="50-7"></a> <b>7</b> Then Joseph went to bury his father, and all the servants of Pharaoh accompanied him&#x2014;the elders of Pharaoh&rsquo;s household and all the elders of the land of Egypt&#x2014; 
<a id="50-8"></a> <b>8</b> along with all of Joseph&rsquo;s household, and his brothers, and his father&rsquo;s household. Only their children and flocks and herds were left in Goshen.

<p>
<a id="50-9"></a> <b>9</b> Chariots and horsemen alike went up with him, and it was an exceedingly large procession. 
<a id="50-10"></a> <b>10</b> When they reached the threshing floor of Atad, which is across the Jordan, they lamented and wailed loudly, and Joseph mourned for his father seven days.
</p>

<p>
<a id="50-11"></a> <b>11</b> When the Canaanites of the land saw the mourning at the threshing floor of Atad, they said, “This is a solemn ceremony of mourning by the Egyptians.” Thus the place across the Jordan is called Abel-mizraim.
</p>

<p>
<a id="50-12"></a> <b>12</b> So Jacob&rsquo;s sons did as he had charged them. 
<a id="50-13"></a> <b>13</b> They carried him to the land of Canaan and buried him in the cave at Machpelah in the field near Mamre, which Abraham had purchased from Ephron the Hittite as a burial site.

<a id="50-24"></a> <b>24</b> Then Joseph said to his brothers, “I am about to die, but God will surely visit you and bring you up from this land to the land He promised on oath to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.” 
<a id="50-25"></a> <b>25</b> And Joseph made the sons of Israel take an oath and said, “God will surely attend to you, and then you must carry my bones up from this place.”

<a id="50-26"></a> <b>26</b> So Joseph died at the age of 110. And they embalmed his body and placed it in a coffin in Egypt.

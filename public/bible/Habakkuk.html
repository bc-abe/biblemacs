<p>
<a id="1-1"></a> This is the burden that Habakkuk the prophet received in a vision:
</p>

<p>
<a id="1-2"></a> <b>2</b> How long, O LORD, must I call for help
</p>

<p>
but You do not hear,
</p>

<p>
or cry out to You, “Violence!”
</p>

<p>
but You do not save?
</p>

<p>
<a id="1-3"></a> <b>3</b> Why do You make me see iniquity?
</p>

<p>
Why do You tolerate wrongdoing?
</p>

<p>
Destruction and violence are before me.
</p>

<p>
Strife is ongoing, and conflict abounds.
</p>

<p>
<a id="1-4"></a> <b>4</b> Therefore the law is paralyzed,
</p>

<p>
and justice never goes forth.
</p>

<p>
For the wicked hem in the righteous,
</p>

<p>
so that justice is perverted.

</p>

<p>
<a id="1-6"></a> <b>6</b> For behold, I am raising up the Chaldeans &#x2014;

<p>
that ruthless and impetuous nation

<p>
which marches through the breadth of the earth
</p>

<p>
to seize dwellings not their own.
</p>

<p>
<a id="1-7"></a> <b>7</b> They are dreaded and feared;
</p>

<p>
from themselves they derive justice and sovereignty.
</p>

<p>
<a id="1-8"></a> <b>8</b> Their horses are swifter than leopards,
</p>

<p>
fiercer than wolves of the night.
</p>

<p>
Their horsemen charge ahead,

<p>
They fly like a vulture,

their hordes advance like the east wind;

they gather prisoners like sand.

<p>
<a id="1-10"></a> <b>10</b> They scoff at kings
</p>

<p>
and make rulers an object of scorn.
</p>

<p>
They laugh at every fortress
</p>

<p>
and build up siege ramps to seize it.
</p>

<p>
<a id="1-11"></a> <b>11</b> Then they sweep by like the wind

and pass on through.

They are guilty;

their own strength is their god.”

<a id="1-16"></a> <b>16</b> Therefore he sacrifices to his dragnet

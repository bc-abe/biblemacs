<p>
<a id="1-1"></a> On many past occasions and in many different ways, God spoke to our fathers through the prophets. 
<a id="1-2"></a> <b>2</b> But in these last days He has spoken to us by His Son, whom He appointed heir of all things, and through whom He made the universe.
</p>

<p>
<a id="1-3"></a> <b>3</b> The Son is the radiance of God&rsquo;s glory and the exact representation of His nature, upholding all things by His powerful word. After He had provided purification for sins, He sat down at the right hand of the Majesty on high. 
<a id="1-4"></a> <b>4</b> So He became as far superior to the angels as the name He has inherited is excellent beyond theirs. 
<a id="1-5"></a> <b>5</b> For to which of the angels did God ever say:
</p>

<p>
“You are My Son;
today I have become Your Father”?
</p>

<p>
Or again:
</p>

<p>
“I will be His Father,
and He will be My Son”?
</p>

<p>
<a id="1-6"></a> <b>6</b> And again, when God brings His firstborn into the world, He says:
</p>

<p>
“Let all God&rsquo;s angels worship Him.”
<a id="1-7"></a> <b>7</b> Now about the angels He says:
“He makes His angels winds,
His servants flames of fire.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="1-8"></a> <b>8</b> But about the Son He says:
</p>

<p>
“Your throne, O God, endures forever and ever,
and justice is the scepter of Your kingdom.
</p>

<p>
<a id="1-9"></a> <b>9</b> You have loved righteousness
and hated wickedness;
therefore God, Your God, has anointed You
above Your companions with the oil of joy.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="1-10"></a> <b>10</b> And:
</p>

<p>
“In the beginning, O Lord, You laid the foundations of the earth,
and the heavens are the work of Your hands.
<a id="1-11"></a> <b>11</b> They will perish, but You remain;
they will all wear out like a garment.
<a id="1-12"></a> <b>12</b> You will roll them up like a robe;
like a garment they will be changed;
but You remain the same,
and Your years will never end.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="1-13"></a> <b>13</b> Yet to which of the angels did God ever say:
“Sit at My right hand
until I make Your enemies a footstool for Your feet”?
</p>

<p>
<a id="1-14"></a> <b>14</b> Are not the angels ministering spirits sent to serve those who will inherit salvation?

</p>

<p>
<a id="2-1"></a> We must pay closer attention, therefore, to what we have heard, so that we do not drift away. 
<a id="2-2"></a> <b>2</b> For if the message spoken by angels was binding, and every transgression and disobedience received its just punishment, 
<a id="2-3"></a> <b>3</b> how shall we escape if we neglect such a great salvation?
</p>

<p>
This salvation was first announced by the Lord, was confirmed to us by those who heard Him, 
<a id="2-4"></a> <b>4</b> and was affirmed by God through signs, wonders, various miracles, and gifts of the Holy Spirit distributed according to His will.

<h3 id="org6b4e933">Jesus like His Brothers</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org6b4e933">
<p>
<a id="2-5"></a> <b>5</b> For it is not to angels that He has subjected the world to come, about which we are speaking. 
<a id="2-6"></a> <b>6</b> But somewhere it is testified in these words:
</p>

<p>
“What is man that You are mindful of him,
</p>

<p>
or the son of man that You care for him?
</p>

<p>
<a id="2-7"></a> <b>7</b> You made him a little lower than the angels;
</p>

<p>
You crowned him with glory and honor
</p>

<p>
<a id="2-8"></a> <b>8</b> and placed everything under his feet.”
</p>

<p>
When God subjected all things to him, He left nothing outside of his control. Yet at present we do not see everything subject to him. 
<a id="2-9"></a> <b>9</b> But we see Jesus, who was made a little lower than the angels, now crowned with glory and honor because He suffered death, so that by the grace of God He might taste death for everyone.
</p>

<p>
<a id="2-10"></a> <b>10</b> In bringing many sons to glory, it was fitting for God, for whom and through whom all things exist, to make the author of their salvation perfect through suffering. 
<a id="2-11"></a> <b>11</b> For both the One who sanctifies and those who are sanctified are of the same family. So Jesus is not ashamed to call them brothers. 
<a id="2-12"></a> <b>12</b> He says:
</p>

<p>
“I will proclaim Your name to My brothers;
</p>

<p>
I will sing Your praises in the assembly.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="2-13"></a> <b>13</b> And again:
</p>

<p>
“I will put My trust in Him.”
</p>

<p>
And once again:
</p>

<p>
“Here am I, and the children God has given Me.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="2-14"></a> <b>14</b> Now since the children have flesh and blood, He too shared in their humanity, so that by His death He might destroy him who holds the power of death, that is, the devil, 
<a id="2-15"></a> <b>15</b> and free those who all their lives were held in slavery by their fear of death.
</p>

<p>
<a id="2-16"></a> <b>16</b> For surely it is not the angels He helps, but the descendants of Abraham. 
<a id="2-17"></a> <b>17</b> For this reason He had to be made like His brothers in every way, so that He might become a merciful and faithful high priest in service to God, in order to make atonement for the sins of the people. 
<a id="2-18"></a> <b>18</b> Because He Himself suffered when He was tempted, He is able to help those who are being tempted.

</p>

<p>
<a id="3-1"></a> Therefore, holy brothers, who share in the heavenly calling, set your focus on Jesus, the apostle and high priest whom we confess. 
<a id="3-2"></a> <b>2</b> He was faithful to the One who appointed Him, just as Moses was faithful in all God&rsquo;s house.
</p>

<p>
<a id="3-3"></a> <b>3</b> For Jesus has been counted worthy of greater glory than Moses, just as the builder of a house has greater honor than the house itself. 
<a id="3-4"></a> <b>4</b> And every house is built by someone, but God is the builder of everything.
</p>

<p>
<a id="3-5"></a> <b>5</b> Now Moses was faithful as a servant in all God&rsquo;s house, testifying to what would be spoken later. 
<a id="3-6"></a> <b>6</b> But Christ is faithful as the Son over God&rsquo;s house. And we are His house, if we hold firmly to our confidence and the hope of which we boast.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org2a263fb">
<p>
<a id="3-7"></a> <b>7</b> Therefore, as the Holy Spirit says:
</p>

<p>
“Today, if you hear His voice,
</p>

<p>
<a id="3-8"></a> <b>8</b> do not harden your hearts,
</p>

in the day of testing in the wilderness,

</p>

<p>
and for forty years saw My works.
</p>

<p>
<a id="3-10"></a> <b>10</b> Therefore I was angry with that generation,
</p>

<p>
and I said,
</p>

<p>
‘Their hearts are always going astray,
</p>

<p>
and they have not known My ways.&rsquo;
</p>

<p>
<a id="3-11"></a> <b>11</b> So I swore on oath in My anger,

‘They shall never enter My rest.&rsquo; ”

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org6832bf3">
<p>
<a id="3-12"></a> <b>12</b> See to it, brothers, that none of you has a wicked heart of unbelief that turns away from the living God. 
<a id="3-13"></a> <b>13</b> But exhort one another daily, as long as it is called today, so that none of you may be hardened by sin&rsquo;s deceitfulness.
</p>

<p>
<a id="3-14"></a> <b>14</b> We have come to share in Christ if we hold firmly to the end the assurance we had at first. 
<a id="3-15"></a> <b>15</b> As it has been said:
</p>

<p>
“Today, if you hear His voice,
</p>

<p>
do not harden your hearts,
</p>

<p>
as you did in the rebellion.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="3-16"></a> <b>16</b> For who were the ones who heard and rebelled? Were they not all those Moses led out of Egypt? 
<a id="3-17"></a> <b>17</b> And with whom was God angry for forty years? Was it not with those who sinned, whose bodies fell in the wilderness? 
<a id="3-18"></a> <b>18</b> And to whom did He swear that they would never enter His rest? Was it not to those who disobeyed? 
<a id="3-19"></a> <b>19</b> So we see that it was because of their unbelief that they were unable to enter.

<span class="drop">4</span>
</p>

<p>
<a id="4-1"></a> Therefore, while the promise of entering His rest still stands, let us be careful that none of you be deemed to have fallen short of it. 
<a id="4-2"></a> <b>2</b> For we also received the good news just as they did; but the message they heard was of no value to them, since they did not share the faith of those who comprehended it.
</p>

<p>
<a id="4-3"></a> <b>3</b> Now we who have believed enter that rest. As for the others, it is just as God has said:
</p>

<p>
“So I swore on oath in My anger,
</p>

<p>
‘They shall never enter My rest.&rsquo; ”
</p>

<p>
And yet His works have been finished since the foundation of the world. 
<a id="4-4"></a> <b>4</b> For somewhere He has spoken about the seventh day in this manner: “And on the seventh day God rested from all His works.” 
<a id="4-5"></a> <b>5</b> And again, as He says in the passage above: “They shall never enter My rest.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="4-6"></a> <b>6</b> Since, then, it remains for some to enter His rest, and since those who formerly heard the good news did not enter because of their disobedience, 
<a id="4-7"></a> <b>7</b> God again designated a certain day as “Today,” when a long time later He spoke through David as was just stated: “Today, if you hear His voice, do not harden your hearts.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="4-8"></a> <b>8</b> For if Joshua had given them rest, God would not have spoken later about another day. 
<a id="4-9"></a> <b>9</b> There remains, then, a Sabbath rest for the people of God. 
<a id="4-10"></a> <b>10</b> For whoever enters God&rsquo;s rest also rests from his own work, just as God did from His. 
<a id="4-11"></a> <b>11</b> Let us, therefore, make every effort to enter that rest, so that no one will fall by following the same pattern of disobedience.

<a id="4-12"></a> <b>12</b> For the word of God is living and active. Sharper than any double-edged sword, it pierces even to dividing soul and spirit, joints and marrow. It judges the thoughts and intentions of the heart. 
<a id="4-13"></a> <b>13</b> Nothing in all creation is hidden from God&rsquo;s sight; everything is uncovered and exposed before the eyes of Him to whom we must give account.
</p>

<p>
<a id="4-14"></a> <b>14</b> Therefore, since we have a great high priest who has passed through the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold firmly to what we profess. 
<a id="4-15"></a> <b>15</b> For we do not have a high priest who is unable to sympathize with our weaknesses, but we have one who was tempted in every way that we are, yet was without sin.

</p>

<p>
<a id="5-1"></a> Every high priest is appointed from among men to represent them in matters relating to God, to offer gifts and sacrifices for sins. 
<a id="5-2"></a> <b>2</b> He is able to deal gently with those who are ignorant and misguided, since he himself is beset by weakness. 
<a id="5-3"></a> <b>3</b> That is why he is obligated to offer sacrifices for his own sins, as well as for the sins of the people.
</p>

<p>
<a id="5-4"></a> <b>4</b> No one takes this honor upon himself; he must be called by God, just as Aaron was. 
<a id="5-5"></a> <b>5</b> So also Christ did not take upon Himself the glory of becoming a high priest, but He was called by the One who said to Him:
</p>

<p>
“You are My Son;
</p>

<p>
today I have become Your Father.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="5-6"></a> <b>6</b> And in another passage God says:
</p>

<p>
“You are a priest forever
</p>

<p>
in the order of Melchizedek.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="5-7"></a> <b>7</b> During the days of Jesus&rsquo; earthly life, He offered up prayers and petitions with loud cries and tears to the One who could save Him from death, and He was heard because of His reverence. 
<a id="5-8"></a> <b>8</b> Although He was a Son, He learned obedience from what He suffered. 
<a id="5-9"></a> <b>9</b> And having been made perfect, He became the source of eternal salvation to all who obey Him 
<a id="5-10"></a> <b>10</b> and was designated by God as high priest in the order of Melchizedek.

<p>
<span class="drop">6</span>
</p>

<p>
<a id="6-1"></a> Therefore let us leave the elementary teachings about Christ and go on to maturity, not laying again the foundation of repentance from dead works, and of faith in God, 
<a id="6-2"></a> <b>2</b> instruction about baptisms, the laying on of hands, the resurrection of the dead, and eternal judgment. 
<a id="6-3"></a> <b>3</b> And this we will do, if God permits.
</p>

<p>
<a id="6-4"></a> <b>4</b> It is impossible for those who have once been enlightened, who have tasted the heavenly gift, who have shared in the Holy Spirit, 
<a id="6-5"></a> <b>5</b> who have tasted the goodness of the word of God and the powers of the coming age&#x2014; 
<a id="6-6"></a> <b>6</b> and then have fallen away&#x2014;to be restored to repentance, because they themselves are crucifying the Son of God all over again and subjecting Him to open shame.
</p>

<p>
<a id="6-7"></a> <b>7</b> For land that drinks in the rain often falling on it and that produces a crop useful to those for whom it is tended receives the blessing of God. 
<a id="6-8"></a> <b>8</b> But land that produces thorns and thistles is worthless, and its curse is imminent. In the end it will be burned.
</p>

<p>
<a id="6-9"></a> <b>9</b> Even though we speak like this, beloved, we are convinced of better things in your case&#x2014;things that accompany salvation. 
<a id="6-10"></a> <b>10</b> For God is not unjust. He will not forget your work and the love you have shown for His name as you have ministered to the saints and continue to do so.
</p>

<p>
<a id="6-11"></a> <b>11</b> We want each of you to show this same diligence to the very end, in order to make your hope sure.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org85e8ce5">
<p>
<a id="6-13"></a> <b>13</b> When God made His promise to Abraham, since He had no one greater to swear by, He swore by Himself, 
<a id="6-14"></a> <b>14</b> saying, “I will surely bless you and multiply your descendants.” 
<a id="6-15"></a> <b>15</b> And so Abraham, after waiting patiently, obtained the promise.
</p>

<p>
<a id="6-16"></a> <b>16</b> Men swear by someone greater than themselves, and their oath serves as a confirmation to end all argument. 
<a id="6-17"></a> <b>17</b> So when God wanted to make the unchanging nature of His purpose very clear to the heirs of the promise, He guaranteed it with an oath. 
<a id="6-18"></a> <b>18</b> Thus by two unchangeable things in which it is impossible for God to lie, we who have fled to take hold of the hope set before us may be strongly encouraged.
</p>

<p>
<a id="6-19"></a> <b>19</b> We have this hope as an anchor for the soul, firm and secure. It enters the inner sanctuary behind the curtain,

<a id="7-1"></a> This Melchizedek was king of Salem and priest of God Most High. He met Abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings and blessed him,

<a id="7-3"></a> <b>3</b> Without father or mother or genealogy, without beginning of days or end of life, like the Son of God, he remains a priest for all time.
</p>

<p>
<a id="7-4"></a> <b>4</b> Consider how great Melchizedek was: Even the patriarch Abraham gave him a tenth of the plunder. 
<a id="7-5"></a> <b>5</b> Now the law commands the sons of Levi who become priests to collect a tenth from the people&#x2014;that is, from their brothers&#x2014;though they too are descended from Abraham.

<p>
<a id="7-8"></a> <b>8</b> In the case of the Levites, mortal men collect the tenth; but in the case of Melchizedek, it is affirmed that he lives on.

<a id="7-13"></a> <b>13</b> He of whom these things are said belonged to a different tribe, from which no one has ever served at the altar. 
<a id="7-14"></a> <b>14</b> For it is clear that our Lord descended from Judah, a tribe as to which Moses said nothing about priests.
</p>

<p>
<a id="7-15"></a> <b>15</b> And this point is even more clear if another priest like Melchizedek appears, 
<a id="7-16"></a> <b>16</b> one who has become a priest not by a law of succession, but by the power of an indestructible life. 
<a id="7-17"></a> <b>17</b> For it is testified:
</p>

<p>
“You are a priest forever
</p>

<p>
in the order of Melchizedek.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="7-18"></a> <b>18</b> So the former commandment is set aside because it was weak and useless 19(for the law made nothing perfect), and a better hope is introduced, by which we draw near to God.
</p>

<p>
<a id="7-20"></a> <b>20</b> And none of this happened without an oath. For others became priests without an oath, 
<a id="7-21"></a> <b>21</b> but Jesus became a priest with an oath by the One who said to Him:
</p>

<p>
“The Lord has sworn and will not change His mind:
</p>

<p>
‘You are a priest forever.&rsquo; ”
</p>

<p>
<a id="7-22"></a> <b>22</b> Because of this oath, Jesus has become the guarantee of a better covenant.
</p>

<p>
<a id="7-23"></a> <b>23</b> Now there have been many other priests, since death prevented them from continuing in office. 
<a id="7-24"></a> <b>24</b> But because Jesus lives forever, He has a permanent priesthood. 
<a id="7-25"></a> <b>25</b> Therefore He is able to save completely those who draw near to God through Him, since He always lives to intercede for them.
</p>

<p>
<a id="7-26"></a> <b>26</b> Such a high priest truly befits us&#x2014;One who is holy, innocent, undefiled, set apart from sinners, and exalted above the heavens. 
<a id="7-27"></a> <b>27</b> Unlike the other high priests, He does not need to offer daily sacrifices, first for His own sins and then for the sins of the people; He sacrificed for sin once for all when He offered up Himself. 
<a id="7-28"></a> <b>28</b> For the law appoints as high priests men who are weak; but the oath, which came after the law, appointed the Son, who has been made perfect forever.

<a id="8-3"></a> <b>3</b> And since every high priest is appointed to offer both gifts and sacrifices, it was necessary for this One also to have something to offer.
</p>

<p>
<a id="8-4"></a> <b>4</b> Now if He were on earth, He would not be a priest, since there are already priests who offer gifts according to the law. 
<a id="8-5"></a> <b>5</b> The place where they serve is a copy and shadow of what is in heaven. This is why Moses was warned when he was about to build the tabernacle: “See to it that you make everything according to the pattern shown you on the mountain.”

<a id="8-6"></a> <b>6</b> Now, however, Jesus has received a much more excellent ministry, just as the covenant He mediates is better and is founded on better promises. 
<a id="8-7"></a> <b>7</b> For if that first covenant had been without fault, no place would have been sought for a second.

</p>

<p>
<a id="9-1"></a> Now the first covenant had regulations for worship and also an earthly sanctuary. 
<a id="9-2"></a> <b>2</b> A tabernacle was prepared. In its first room were the lampstand, the table, and the consecrated bread. This was called the Holy Place. 
<a id="9-3"></a> <b>3</b> Behind the second curtain was a room called the Most Holy Place, 
<a id="9-4"></a> <b>4</b> containing the golden altar of incense and the gold-covered ark of the covenant. Inside the ark were the gold jar of manna, Aaron&rsquo;s staff that had budded, and the stone tablets of the covenant. 
<a id="9-5"></a> <b>5</b> Above the ark were the cherubim of glory, overshadowing the mercy seat. But we cannot discuss these things in detail now.
</p>

<p>
<a id="9-6"></a> <b>6</b> When everything had been prepared in this way, the priests entered regularly into the first room to perform their sacred duties. 
<a id="9-7"></a> <b>7</b> But only the high priest entered the second room, and then only once a year, and never without blood, which he offered for himself and for the sins the people had committed in ignorance.
</p>

<p>
<a id="9-8"></a> <b>8</b> By this arrangement the Holy Spirit was showing that the way into the Most Holy Place had not yet been disclosed as long as the first tabernacle was still standing. 
<a id="9-9"></a> <b>9</b> It is an illustration for the present time, because the gifts and sacrifices being offered were unable to cleanse the conscience of the worshiper.

<h3 id="org2028627">Redemption through His Blood</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org2028627">
<p>
<a id="9-11"></a> <b>11</b> But when Christ came as high priest of the good things that have come, He went through the greater and more perfect tabernacle that is not made by hands and is not a part of this creation. 
<a id="9-12"></a> <b>12</b> He did not enter by the blood of goats and calves, but He entered the Most Holy Place once for all by His own blood, thus securing eternal redemption.
</p>

<p>
<a id="9-13"></a> <b>13</b> For if the blood of goats and bulls and the ashes of a heifer sprinkled on those who are ceremonially unclean sanctify them so that their bodies are clean, 
<a id="9-14"></a> <b>14</b> how much more will the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered Himself unblemished to God, purify our consciences from works of death, so that we may serve the living God!
</p>

<p>
<a id="9-15"></a> <b>15</b> Therefore Christ is the mediator of a new covenant, so that those who are called may receive the promised eternal inheritance, now that He has died to redeem them from the transgressions committed under the first covenant.
</p>

<p>
<a id="9-16"></a> <b>16</b> In the case of a will, it is necessary to establish the death of the one who made it, 
<a id="9-17"></a> <b>17</b> because a will does not take effect until the one who made it has died; it cannot be executed while he is still alive.
</p>

<p>
<a id="9-18"></a> <b>18</b> That is why even the first covenant was not put into effect without blood. 
<a id="9-19"></a> <b>19</b> For when Moses had proclaimed every commandment of the law to all the people, he took the blood of calves and goats, along with water, scarlet wool, and hyssop, and sprinkled the scroll and all the people, 
<a id="9-20"></a> <b>20</b> saying, “This is the blood of the covenant, which God has commanded you to keep.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="9-21"></a> <b>21</b> In the same way, he sprinkled with blood the tabernacle and all the vessels used in worship. 
<a id="9-22"></a> <b>22</b> According to the law, in fact, nearly everything must be purified with blood, and without the shedding of blood there is no forgiveness.
</p>

<p>
<a id="9-23"></a> <b>23</b> So it was necessary for the copies of the heavenly things to be purified with these sacrifices, but the heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these. 
<a id="9-24"></a> <b>24</b> For Christ did not enter a man-made copy of the true sanctuary, but He entered heaven itself, now to appear on our behalf in the presence of God.
</p>

<p>
<a id="9-25"></a> <b>25</b> Nor did He enter heaven to offer Himself again and again, as the high priest enters the Most Holy Place every year with blood that is not his own. 
<a id="9-26"></a> <b>26</b> Otherwise, Christ would have had to suffer repeatedly since the foundation of the world. But now He has appeared once for all at the end of the ages to do away with sin by the sacrifice of Himself.
</p>

<p>
<a id="9-27"></a> <b>27</b> Just as man is appointed to die once, and after that to face judgment, 
<a id="9-28"></a> <b>28</b> so also Christ was offered once to bear the sins of many; and He will appear a second time, not to bear sin, but to bring salvation to those who eagerly await Him.

</p>

<p>
<a id="10-1"></a> For the law is only a shadow of the good things to come, not the realities themselves. It can never, by the same sacrifices offered year after year, make perfect those who draw near to worship. 
<a id="10-2"></a> <b>2</b> If it could, would not the offerings have ceased? For the worshipers would have been cleansed once for all, and would no longer have felt the guilt of their sins.
</p>

<p>
<a id="10-3"></a> <b>3</b> Instead, those sacrifices are an annual reminder of sins, 
<a id="10-4"></a> <b>4</b> because it is impossible for the blood of bulls and goats to take away sins. 
<a id="10-5"></a> <b>5</b> Therefore, when Christ came into the world, He said:
</p>

<p>
“Sacrifice and offering You did not desire,
</p>

<p>
but a body You prepared for Me.
</p>

<p>
<a id="10-6"></a> <b>6</b> In burnt offerings and sin offerings
</p>

<p>
You took no delight.
</p>

<p>
<a id="10-7"></a> <b>7</b> Then I said, ‘Here I am, it is written about Me in the scroll:
</p>

<p>
I have come to do Your will, O God.&rsquo; ”
</p>

<p>
<a id="10-8"></a> <b>8</b> In the passage above He says, “Sacrifices and offerings, burnt offerings and sin offerings You did not desire, nor did You delight in them” (although they are offered according to the law). 
<a id="10-9"></a> <b>9</b> Then He adds, “Here I am, I have come to do Your will.” He takes away the first to establish the second. 
<a id="10-10"></a> <b>10</b> And by that will, we have been sanctified through the sacrifice of the body of Jesus Christ once for all.
</p>

<p>
<a id="10-11"></a> <b>11</b> Day after day every priest stands to minister and to offer again and again the same sacrifices, which can never take away sins. 
<a id="10-12"></a> <b>12</b> But when this Priest had offered for all time one sacrifice for sins, He sat down at the right hand of God. 
<a id="10-13"></a> <b>13</b> Since that time, He waits for His enemies to be made a footstool for His feet, 
<a id="10-14"></a> <b>14</b> because by a single offering He has made perfect for all time those who are being sanctified.
</p>

<p>
<a id="10-15"></a> <b>15</b> The Holy Spirit also testifies to us about this. First He says:
</p>

<p>
<a id="10-16"></a> <b>16</b> “This is the covenant I will make with them
</p>

<p>
after those days, declares the Lord.
</p>

<p>
I will put My laws in their hearts
</p>

<p>
and inscribe them on their minds.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="10-17"></a> <b>17</b> Then He adds:
</p>

<p>
“Their sins and lawless acts
</p>

<p>
I will remember no more.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="10-18"></a> <b>18</b> And where these have been forgiven, an offering for sin is no longer needed.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgbf656ae">
<p>
<a id="10-19"></a> <b>19</b> Therefore, brothers, since we have confidence to enter the Most Holy Place by the blood of Jesus, 
<a id="10-20"></a> <b>20</b> by the new and living way opened for us through the curtain of His body, 
<a id="10-21"></a> <b>21</b> and since we have a great priest over the house of God, 
<a id="10-22"></a> <b>22</b> let us draw near with a sincere heart in full assurance of faith, having our hearts sprinkled to cleanse us from a guilty conscience and our bodies washed with pure water.
</p>

<p>
<a id="10-23"></a> <b>23</b> Let us hold resolutely to the hope we profess, for He who promised is faithful. 
<a id="10-24"></a> <b>24</b> And let us consider how to spur one another on to love and good deeds. 
<a id="10-25"></a> <b>25</b> Let us not neglect meeting together, as some have made a habit, but let us encourage one another, and all the more as you see the Day approaching.
</p>

<p>
<a id="10-26"></a> <b>26</b> If we deliberately go on sinning after we have received the knowledge of the truth, no further sacrifice for sins remains, 
<a id="10-27"></a> <b>27</b> but only a fearful expectation of judgment and of raging fire that will consume all adversaries. 
<a id="10-28"></a> <b>28</b> Anyone who rejected the law of Moses died without mercy on the testimony of two or three witnesses. 
<a id="10-29"></a> <b>29</b> How much more severely do you think one deserves to be punished who has trampled on the Son of God, profaned the blood of the covenant that sanctified him, and insulted the Spirit of grace?
</p>

<p>
<a id="10-30"></a> <b>30</b> For we know Him who said, “Vengeance is Mine; I will repay,” and again, “The Lord will judge His people.” 
<a id="10-31"></a> <b>31</b> It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God.
</p>

<p>
<a id="10-32"></a> <b>32</b> Remember the early days that you were in the light. In those days, you endured a great conflict in the face of suffering. 
<a id="10-33"></a> <b>33</b> Sometimes you were publicly exposed to ridicule and persecution; at other times you were partners with those who were so treated. 
<a id="10-34"></a> <b>34</b> You sympathized with those in prison and joyfully accepted the confiscation of your property, knowing that you yourselves had a better and permanent possession.
</p>

<p>
<a id="10-35"></a> <b>35</b> So do not throw away your confidence; it holds a great reward. 
<a id="10-36"></a> <b>36</b> You need to persevere, so that after you have done the will of God, you will receive what He has promised. 
<a id="10-37"></a> <b>37</b> For,
</p>

<p>
“In just a little while,
</p>

<p>
He who is coming will come and will not delay.
</p>

<p>
<a id="10-38"></a> <b>38</b> But My righteous one will live by faith;
</p>

<p>
and if he shrinks back,
</p>

<p>
I will take no pleasure in him.”

<p>

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org8c684ca">
<p>
<a id="12-4"></a> <b>4</b> In your struggle against sin, you have not yet resisted to the point of shedding your blood. 
<a id="12-5"></a> <b>5</b> And you have forgotten the exhortation that addresses you as sons:
</p>

<p>
“My son, do not take lightly the discipline of the Lord,
</p>

<p>
and do not lose heart when He rebukes you.
</p>

<p>
<a id="12-6"></a> <b>6</b> For the Lord disciplines the one He loves,
</p>

<p>
and He chastises every son He receives.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="12-7"></a> <b>7</b> Endure suffering as discipline; God is treating you as sons. For what son is not disciplined by his father? 
<a id="12-8"></a> <b>8</b> If you do not experience discipline like everyone else, then you are illegitimate children and not true sons. 
<a id="12-9"></a> <b>9</b> Furthermore, we have all had earthly fathers who disciplined us, and we respected them. Should we not much more submit to the Father of our spirits and live?
</p>

<p>
<a id="12-10"></a> <b>10</b> Our fathers disciplined us for a short time as they thought best, but God disciplines us for our good, so that we may share in His holiness. 
<a id="12-11"></a> <b>11</b> No discipline seems enjoyable at the time, but painful. Later on, however, it yields a harvest of righteousness and peace to those who have been trained by it.
</p>

<p>
<a id="12-12"></a> <b>12</b> Therefore strengthen your limp hands and weak knees. 
<a id="12-13"></a> <b>13</b> Make straight paths for your feet, so that the lame may not be disabled, but rather healed.

<a id="12-14"></a> <b>14</b> Pursue peace with everyone, as well as holiness, without which no one will see the Lord. 
<a id="12-15"></a> <b>15</b> See to it that no one falls short of the grace of God, and that no root of bitterness springs up to cause trouble and defile many. 
<a id="12-16"></a> <b>16</b> See to it that no one is sexually immoral, or is godless like Esau, who for a single meal sold his birthright. 
<a id="12-17"></a> <b>17</b> For you know that afterward, when he wanted to inherit the blessing, he was rejected. He could find no ground for repentance, though he sought the blessing with tears.

<a id="12-19"></a> <b>19</b> to a trumpet blast or to a voice that made its hearers beg that no further word be spoken. 
<a id="12-20"></a> <b>20</b> For they could not bear what was commanded: “If even an animal touches the mountain, it must be stoned.” 
<a id="12-21"></a> <b>21</b> The sight was so terrifying that even Moses said, “I am trembling with fear.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="12-22"></a> <b>22</b> Instead, you have come to Mount Zion, to the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem. You have come to myriads of angels 
<a id="12-23"></a> <b>23</b> in joyful assembly, to the congregation of the firstborn, enrolled in heaven. You have come to God the Judge of all, to the spirits of the righteous made perfect, 
<a id="12-24"></a> <b>24</b> to Jesus the mediator of a new covenant, and to the sprinkled blood that speaks a better word than the blood of Abel.
</p>

<p>
<a id="12-25"></a> <b>25</b> See to it that you do not refuse Him who speaks. For if the people did not escape when they refused Him who warned them on earth, how much less will we escape if we reject Him who warns us from heaven? 
<a id="12-26"></a> <b>26</b> At that time His voice shook the earth, but now He has promised, “Once more I will shake not only the earth, but heaven as well.” 
<a id="12-27"></a> <b>27</b> The words “Once more” signify the removal of what can be shaken&#x2014;that is, created things&#x2014;so that the unshakable may remain.

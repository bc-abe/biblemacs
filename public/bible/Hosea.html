<p>
<a id="1-1"></a> This is the word of the LORD that came to Hosea son of Beeri in the days of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah, and of Jeroboam son of Jehoash, king of Israel.
</p>

<p>
<a id="1-2"></a> <b>2</b> When the LORD first spoke through Hosea, He told him, “Go, take a prostitute as your wife and have children of adultery, because this land is flagrantly prostituting itself by departing from the LORD.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="1-3"></a> <b>3</b> So Hosea went and married Gomer daughter of Diblaim, and she conceived and bore him a son.
</p>

<p>
<a id="1-4"></a> <b>4</b> Then the LORD said to Hosea, “Name him Jezreel, for soon I will bring the bloodshed of Jezreel upon the house of Jehu, and I will put an end to the kingdom of Israel. 
<a id="1-5"></a> <b>5</b> And on that day I will break the bow of Israel in the Valley of Jezreel.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="1-6"></a> <b>6</b> Gomer again conceived and gave birth to a daughter, and the LORD said to Hosea, “Name her Lo-ruhamah, for I will no longer have compassion on the house of Israel, that I should ever forgive them. 
<a id="1-7"></a> <b>7</b> Yet I will have compassion on the house of Judah, and I will save them&#x2014;not by bow or sword or war, not by horses and cavalry, but by the LORD their God.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="1-8"></a> <b>8</b> After she had weaned Lo-ruhamah, Gomer conceived and gave birth to a son. 
<a id="1-9"></a> <b>9</b> And the LORD said, “Name him Lo-ammi, for you are not My people, and I am not your God.
</p>

<p>
<a id="1-10"></a> <b>10</b> Yet the number of the Israelites will be like the sand of the sea, which cannot be measured or counted. And it will happen that in the very place where it was said to them, ‘You are not My people,&rsquo; they will be called ‘sons of the living God.&rsquo; 
<a id="1-11"></a> <b>11</b> Then the people of Judah and of Israel will be gathered together, and they will appoint for themselves one leader, and will go up out of the land. For great will be the day of Jezreel.

Let her remove the adultery from her face

<p>
<a id="2-5"></a> <b>5</b> For their mother has played the harlot

‘I will go after my lovers,

<p>
I will enclose her with a wall,

so she cannot find her way.

<p>
<a id="2-7"></a> <b>7</b> She will pursue her lovers but not catch them;

she will seek them but not find them.

Then she will say,

<p>
‘I will return to my first husband,
</p>

<p>
for then I was better off than now.&rsquo;
</p>

<p>
<a id="2-8"></a> <b>8</b> For she does not acknowledge

<p>
that it was I who gave her grain,
</p>

<p>
new wine, and oil,
</p>

<p>
who lavished on her silver and gold&#x2014;

<a id="2-9"></a> <b>9</b> Therefore I will take back My grain in its time

I will take away My wool and linen,

<a id="2-10"></a> <b>10</b> And then I will expose her lewdness

in the sight of her lovers,

and no one will deliver her

out of My hands.

<p>
<a id="2-11"></a> <b>11</b> I will put an end to all her exultation:

her feasts, New Moons, and Sabbaths&#x2014;
</p>

<p>
all her appointed feasts.
</p>

<p>
<a id="2-12"></a> <b>12</b> I will destroy her vines and fig trees,

<p>
which she thinks are the wages paid by her lovers.

<p>
So I will make them into a thicket,
</p>

<p>
and the beasts of the field will devour them.
</p>

<p>
<a id="2-13"></a> <b>13</b> I will punish her for the days of the Baals
</p>

<p>
when she burned incense to them,
</p>

<p>
when she decked herself with rings and jewelry,
</p>

<p>
and went after her lovers.
</p>

<p>
But Me she forgot,”

<a id="2-14"></a> <b>14</b> “Therefore, behold, I will allure her

“you will call Me ‘my Husband,&rsquo;

<p>
<a id="2-17"></a> <b>17</b> For I will remove from her lips the names of the Baals;

And I will abolish bow and sword

O children of Israel,

for the LORD has a case

<p>
against the people of the land:
</p>

<p>
“There is no truth, no loving devotion,
</p>

<p>
and no knowledge of God in the land!
</p>

<p>
<a id="4-2"></a> <b>2</b> Cursing and lying,
</p>

<p>
murder and stealing,
</p>

<p>
and adultery are rampant;
</p>

<p>
one act of bloodshed follows another.
</p>

<p>
<a id="4-3"></a> <b>3</b> Therefore the land mourns,
</p>

<p>
and all who dwell in it will waste away

<p>
with the beasts of the field and the birds of the air;

<p>
even the fish of the sea disappear.
</p>

<p>
<a id="4-4"></a> <b>4</b> But let no man contend;
</p>

<p>
let no man offer reproof;

<p>
for your people are like those

who contend with a priest.

<p>
<a id="4-5"></a> <b>5</b> You will stumble by day,

<p>
and the prophet will stumble with you by night;

so I will destroy your mother&#x2014;

<p>
<a id="4-6"></a> <b>6</b> My people are destroyed

<p>
for lack of knowledge.
</p>

<p>
Because you have rejected knowledge,
</p>

<p>
I will also reject you as My priests.
</p>

<p>
Since you have forgotten the law of your God,
</p>

<p>
I will also forget your children.
</p>

<p>
<a id="4-7"></a> <b>7</b> The more they multiplied,

<p>
the more they sinned against Me;

<p>
they exchanged their Glory

<p>
for a thing of disgrace.
</p>

<p>
<a id="4-8"></a> <b>8</b> They feed on the sins of My people
</p>

<p>
and set their hearts on iniquity.
</p>

<p>
<a id="4-9"></a> <b>9</b> And it shall be

<p>
like people, like priest.

they will be promiscuous but not multiply.

<a id="4-11"></a> <b>11</b> Promiscuity, wine, and new wine

take away understanding.

<p>
<a id="4-12"></a> <b>12</b> My people consult their wooden idols,

For a spirit of prostitution leads them astray

<p>
and they have played the harlot against their God.

<p>
<a id="4-13"></a> <b>13</b> They sacrifice on the mountaintops

<p>
and burn offerings on the hills,
</p>

<p>
under oak, poplar, and terebinth,
</p>

<p>
because their shade is pleasant.
</p>

<p>
And so your daughters turn to prostitution
</p>

<p>
and your daughters-in-law to adultery.
</p>

<p>
<a id="4-14"></a> <b>14</b> I will not punish your daughters
</p>

<p>
when they prostitute themselves,
</p>

<p>
nor your daughters-in-law

<p>
when they commit adultery.
</p>

<p>
For the men themselves go off with prostitutes
</p>

<p>
and offer sacrifices with shrine prostitutes.

<p>
So a people without understanding

will come to ruin.

<a id="4-15"></a> <b>15</b> Though you prostitute yourself, O Israel,

<p>
and do not swear on oath,

‘As surely as the LORD lives!&rsquo;

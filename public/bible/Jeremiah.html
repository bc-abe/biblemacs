<p>
<a id="1-1"></a> These are the words of Jeremiah son of Hilkiah, one of the priests in Anathoth in the territory of Benjamin.
</p>

<p>
<a id="1-2"></a> <b>2</b> The word of the LORD came to Jeremiah in the thirteenth year of the reign of Josiah son of Amon king of Judah, 
<a id="1-3"></a> <b>3</b> and through the days of Jehoiakim son of Josiah king of Judah, until the fifth month of the eleventh year of Zedekiah son of Josiah king of Judah, when the people of Jerusalem went into exile.
</p>

<p>
<a id="1-4"></a> <b>4</b> The word of the LORD came to me, saying:
</p>

<p>
<a id="1-5"></a> <b>5</b> “Before I formed you in the womb I knew you,
</p>

<p>
and before you were born I set you apart
</p>

<p>
and appointed you as a prophet to the nations.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="1-6"></a> <b>6</b> “Ah, Lord GOD,” I said, “I surely do not know how to speak, for I am only a child!”
</p>

<p>
<a id="1-7"></a> <b>7</b> But the LORD told me:
</p>

<p>
“Do not say,
</p>

<p>
‘I am only a child.&rsquo;
</p>

<p>
For to everyone I send you,
</p>

<p>
you must go,
</p>

<p>
and all that I command you,
</p>

<p>
you must speak.
</p>

<p>
<a id="1-8"></a> <b>8</b> Do not be afraid of them,
</p>

<p>
for I am with you to deliver you,”
</p>

<p>
declares the LORD.
</p>

<p>
<a id="1-9"></a> <b>9</b> Then the LORD reached out His hand, touched my mouth, and said to me:
</p>

<p>
“Behold, I have put My words
</p>

<p>
in your mouth.
</p>

<p>
<a id="1-10"></a> <b>10</b> See, I have appointed you today
</p>

<p>
over nations and kingdoms
</p>

<p>
to uproot and tear down,
</p>

<p>
to destroy and overthrow,
</p>

<p>
to build and plant.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="1-11"></a> <b>11</b> And the word of the LORD came to me, asking, “Jeremiah, what do you see?”
</p>

<p>
“I see a branch of an almond tree,” I replied.
</p>

<p>
<a id="1-12"></a> <b>12</b> “You have observed correctly,” said the LORD, “for I am watching over My word to accomplish it.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="1-13"></a> <b>13</b> Again the word of the LORD came to me, asking, “What do you see?”
</p>

<p>
“I see a boiling pot,” I replied, “and it is tilting toward us from the north.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="1-14"></a> <b>14</b> Then the LORD said to me, “Disaster from the north will be poured out on all who live in the land. 
<a id="1-15"></a> <b>15</b> For I am about to summon all the clans and kingdoms of the north,” declares the LORD.
</p>

<p>
“Their kings will come and set up their thrones
</p>

<p>
at the entrance of the gates of Jerusalem.
</p>

<p>
They will attack all her surrounding walls
</p>

<p>
and all the other cities of Judah.
</p>

<p>
<a id="1-16"></a> <b>16</b> I will pronounce My judgments against them
</p>

<p>
for all their wickedness,
</p>

<p>
because they have forsaken Me
</p>

<p>
to burn incense to other gods
</p>

<p>
and to worship the works of their own hands.
</p>

<p>
<a id="1-17"></a> <b>17</b> Get yourself ready. Stand up and tell them everything that I command you. Do not be intimidated by them, or I will terrify you before them. 
<a id="1-18"></a> <b>18</b> Now behold, this day I have made you like a fortified city, an iron pillar, and bronze walls against the whole land&#x2014;against the kings of Judah, its officials, its priests, and the people of the land. 
<a id="1-19"></a> <b>19</b> They will fight against you but will never overcome you, since I am with you to deliver you,” declares the LORD.

“What fault did your fathers find in Me

<p>
<a id="2-8"></a> <b>8</b> The priests did not ask,

<p>
‘Where is the LORD?&rsquo;
</p>

<p>
The experts in the law no longer knew Me,

<p>
and the leaders rebelled against Me.

</p>

<p>
<a id="7-1"></a> This is the word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD, saying,
<a id="7-2"></a> <b>2</b> “Stand in the gate of the house of the LORD and proclaim this message: Hear the word of the LORD, all you people of Judah who enter through these gates to worship the LORD. 
<a id="7-3"></a> <b>3</b> Thus says the LORD of Hosts, the God of Israel: Correct your ways and deeds, and I will let you live in this place. 
<a id="7-4"></a> <b>4</b> Do not trust in deceptive words, chanting:
</p>

<p>
‘This is the temple of the LORD,
</p>

<p>
the temple of the LORD,
</p>

<p>
the temple of the LORD.&rsquo;
</p>

<p>
<a id="7-5"></a> <b>5</b> For if you really correct your ways and deeds, if you act justly toward one another, 
<a id="7-6"></a> <b>6</b> if you no longer oppress the foreigner and the fatherless and the widow, and if you no longer shed innocent blood in this place or follow other gods to your own harm, 
<a id="7-7"></a> <b>7</b> then I will let you live in this place, in the land that I gave to your fathers forever and ever.
</p>

<p>
<a id="7-8"></a> <b>8</b> But look, you keep trusting in deceptive words to no avail. 
<a id="7-9"></a> <b>9</b> Will you steal and murder, commit adultery and perjury, burn incense to Baal, and follow other gods that you have not known, 
<a id="7-10"></a> <b>10</b> and then come and stand before Me in this house, which bears My Name, and say, ‘We are delivered, so we can continue with all these abominations&rsquo;? 
<a id="7-11"></a> <b>11</b> Has this house, which bears My Name, become a den of robbers in your sight? Yes, I too have seen it, declares the LORD.
</p>

<p>
<a id="7-12"></a> <b>12</b> But go now to the place in Shiloh where I first made a dwelling for My Name, and see what I did to it because of the wickedness of My people Israel. 
<a id="7-13"></a> <b>13</b> And now, because you have done all these things, declares the LORD, and because I have spoken to you again and again but you would not listen, and I have called to you but you would not answer, 
<a id="7-14"></a> <b>14</b> therefore what I did to Shiloh I will now do to the house that bears My Name, the house in which you trust, the place that I gave to you and your fathers. 
<a id="7-15"></a> <b>15</b> And I will cast you out of My presence, just as I have cast out all your brothers, all the descendants of Ephraim.

Judah&rsquo;s Idolatry Persists
</p>

<p>
<a id="7-16"></a> <b>16</b> As for you, do not pray for these people, do not offer a plea or petition on their behalf, and do not beg Me, for I will not listen to you. 
<a id="7-17"></a> <b>17</b> Do you not see what they are doing in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem? 
<a id="7-18"></a> <b>18</b> The sons gather wood, the fathers light the fire, and the women knead the dough to make cakes for the Queen of Heaven; they pour out drink offerings to other gods to provoke Me to anger. 
<a id="7-19"></a> <b>19</b> But am I the One they are provoking? declares the LORD. Is it not themselves they spite, to their own shame?
</p>

<p>
<a id="7-20"></a> <b>20</b> Therefore this is what the Lord GOD says: Behold, My anger and My fury will be poured out on this place, on man and beast, on the trees of the field and the produce of the land, and it will burn and not be extinguished.
</p>

<p>
<a id="7-21"></a> <b>21</b> This is what the LORD of Hosts, the God of Israel, says: Add your burnt offerings to your other sacrifices and eat the meat yourselves! 
<a id="7-22"></a> <b>22</b> For when I brought your fathers out of the land of Egypt, I did not merely command them about burnt offerings and sacrifices, 
<a id="7-23"></a> <b>23</b> but this is what I commanded them: Obey Me, and I will be your God, and you will be My people. You must walk in all the ways I have commanded you, so that it may go well with you.
</p>

<p>
<a id="7-24"></a> <b>24</b> Yet they did not listen or incline their ear, but they followed the stubborn inclinations of their own evil hearts. They went backward and not forward. 
<a id="7-25"></a> <b>25</b> From the day your fathers came out of the land of Egypt until this day, I have sent you all My servants the prophets again and again. 
<a id="7-26"></a> <b>26</b> Yet they would not listen to Me or incline their ear, but they stiffened their necks and did more evil than their fathers.
</p>

<p>
<a id="7-27"></a> <b>27</b> When you tell them all these things, they will not listen to you. When you call to them, they will not answer. 
<a id="7-28"></a> <b>28</b> Therefore you must say to them, ‘This is the nation that would not listen to the voice of the LORD their God and would not receive correction. Truth has perished; it has disappeared from their lips. 
<a id="7-29"></a> <b>29</b> Cut off your hair and throw it away. Raise up a lamentation on the barren heights, for the LORD has rejected and forsaken the generation of His wrath.&rsquo;

<p>
The Valley of Slaughter
</p>

<p>
<a id="7-30"></a> <b>30</b> For the people of Judah have done evil in My sight, declares the LORD. They have set up their abominations in the house that bears My Name, and so have defiled it. 
<a id="7-31"></a> <b>31</b> They have built the high places of Topheth in the Valley of Hinnom so they could burn their sons and daughters in the fire&#x2014;something I never commanded, nor did it even enter My mind.
</p>

<p>
<a id="7-32"></a> <b>32</b> So behold, the days are coming, declares the LORD, when this place will no longer be called Topheth and the Valley of Hinnom, but the Valley of Slaughter. For they will bury the dead in Topheth until there is no more room. 
<a id="7-33"></a> <b>33</b> The corpses of this people will become food for the birds of the air and the beasts of the earth, and there will be no one to scare them away.
</p>

<p>
<a id="7-34"></a> <b>34</b> I will remove from the cities of Judah and the streets of Jerusalem the sounds of joy and gladness and the voices of the bride and bridegroom, for the land will become a wasteland.”

<a id="11-2"></a> <b>2</b> “Listen to the words of this covenant and tell them to the men of Judah and the residents of Jerusalem. 
<a id="11-3"></a> <b>3</b> You must tell them that this is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says: Cursed is the man who does not obey the words of this covenant, 
<a id="11-4"></a> <b>4</b> which I commanded your forefathers when I brought them out of the land of Egypt, out of the iron furnace, saying, ‘Obey Me, and do everything I command you, and you will be My people, and I will be your God.&rsquo; 
<a id="11-5"></a> <b>5</b> This was in order to establish the oath I swore to your forefathers, to give them a land flowing with milk and honey, as it is to this day.”

<p>
“Amen, LORD,” I answered.

<p>
<a id="11-6"></a> <b>6</b> Then the LORD said to me, “Proclaim all these words in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem, saying: Hear the words of this covenant and carry them out. 
<a id="11-7"></a> <b>7</b> For from the time I brought your fathers out of the land of Egypt until today, I strongly warned them again and again, saying, ‘Obey My voice.&rsquo; 
<a id="11-8"></a> <b>8</b> Yet they would not obey or incline their ears, but each one followed the stubbornness of his evil heart. So I brought on them all the curses of this covenant I had commanded them to follow but they did not keep.”

<p>
<a id="11-9"></a> <b>9</b> And the LORD told me, “There is a conspiracy among the men of Judah and the residents of Jerusalem.

<p>
<a id="17-1"></a> “The sin of Judah is written with an iron stylus,
</p>

<p>
engraved with a diamond point
</p>

<p>
on the tablets of their hearts
</p>

<p>
and on the horns of their altars.
</p>

<p>
<a id="17-2"></a> <b>2</b> Even their children remember their altars and Asherah poles
</p>

<p>
by the green trees and on the high hills.
</p>

<p>
<a id="17-3"></a> <b>3</b> O My mountain in the countryside,
</p>

<p>
I will give over your wealth
</p>

<p>
and all your treasures as plunder,
</p>

<p>
because of the sin of your high places,
</p>

<p>
within all your borders.
</p>

<p>
<a id="17-4"></a> <b>4</b> And you yourself will relinquish
</p>

<p>
the inheritance that I gave you.
</p>

<p>
I will enslave you to your enemies
</p>

<p>
in a land that you do not know,
</p>

<p>
for you have kindled My anger;
</p>

<p>
it will burn forever.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="17-5"></a> <b>5</b> This is what the LORD says:
</p>

<p>
“Cursed is the man who trusts in mankind,
</p>

<p>
who makes the flesh his strength
</p>

<p>
and turns his heart from the LORD.
</p>

<p>
<a id="17-6"></a> <b>6</b> He will be like a shrub in the desert;
</p>

<p>
he will not see when prosperity comes.
</p>

<p>
He will dwell in the parched places of the desert,
</p>

<p>
in a salt land where no one lives.
</p>

<p>
<a id="17-7"></a> <b>7</b> But blessed is the man who trusts in the LORD,
</p>

<p>
whose confidence is in Him.
</p>

<p>
<a id="17-8"></a> <b>8</b> He is like a tree planted by the waters
</p>

<p>
that sends out its roots toward the stream.
</p>

<p>
It does not fear when the heat comes,
</p>

<p>
and its leaves are always green.
</p>

<p>
It does not worry in a year of drought,
</p>

<p>
nor does it cease to produce fruit.
</p>

<p>
<a id="17-9"></a> <b>9</b> The heart is deceitful above all things
</p>

<p>
and beyond cure.
</p>

<p>
Who can understand it?
</p>

<p>
<a id="17-10"></a> <b>10</b> I, the LORD, search the heart;
</p>

<p>
I examine the mind
</p>

<p>
to reward a man according to his way,
</p>

<p>
by what his deeds deserve.
</p>

<p>
<a id="17-11"></a> <b>11</b> Like a partridge hatching eggs it did not lay
</p>

<p>
is the man who makes a fortune unjustly.
</p>

<p>
In the middle of his days his riches will desert him,
</p>

<p>
and in the end he will be the fool.”

<p>
<a id="18-1"></a> This is the word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD:
<a id="18-2"></a> <b>2</b> “Go down at once to the potter&rsquo;s house, and there I will reveal My message to you.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="18-3"></a> <b>3</b> So I went down to the potter&rsquo;s house and saw him working at the wheel. 
<a id="18-4"></a> <b>4</b> But the vessel that he was shaping from the clay became flawed in his hand; so he formed it into another vessel, as it seemed best for him to do.
</p>

<p>
<a id="18-5"></a> <b>5</b> Then the word of the LORD came to me, saying,
<a id="18-6"></a> <b>6</b> “O house of Israel, declares the LORD, can I not treat you as this potter treats his clay? Just like clay in the potter&rsquo;s hand, so are you in My hand, O house of Israel.
</p>

<p>
<a id="18-7"></a> <b>7</b> At any time I might announce that a nation or kingdom will be uprooted, torn down, and destroyed. 
<a id="18-8"></a> <b>8</b> But if that nation I warned turns from its evil, then I will relent of the disaster I had planned to bring.
</p>

<p>
<a id="18-9"></a> <b>9</b> And if at another time I announce that I will build up and establish a nation or kingdom, 
<a id="18-10"></a> <b>10</b> and if it does evil in My sight and does not listen to My voice, then I will relent of the good I had intended for it.
</p>

<p>
<a id="18-11"></a> <b>11</b> Now therefore, tell the men of Judah and the residents of Jerusalem that this is what the LORD says: ‘Behold, I am planning a disaster for you and devising a plan against you. Turn now, each of you, from your evil ways, and correct your ways and deeds.&rsquo;
</p>

<p>
<a id="18-12"></a> <b>12</b> But they will reply, ‘It is hopeless. We will follow our own plans, and each of us will act according to the stubbornness of his evil heart.&rsquo; ”
</p>

<p>
<a id="18-13"></a> <b>13</b> Therefore this is what the LORD says:
</p>

<p>
“Inquire among the nations:
</p>

<p>
Who has ever heard things like these?
</p>

<p>
Virgin Israel has done a most terrible thing.
</p>

<p>
<a id="18-14"></a> <b>14</b> Does the snow of Lebanon

</p>

<p>
<a id="18-15"></a> <b>15</b> Yet My people have forgotten Me.

<p>

<p>
<a id="18-16"></a> <b>16</b> They have made their land a desolation,

<p>
Proclaim there the words I speak to you, 
<a id="19-3"></a> <b>3</b> saying, ‘Hear the word of the LORD, O kings of Judah and residents of Jerusalem. This is what the LORD of Hosts, the God of Israel, says: I am going to bring such disaster on this place that the ears of all who hear of it will ring,

<p>
<a id="19-6"></a> <b>6</b> So behold, the days are coming, declares the LORD, when this place will no longer be called Topheth or the Valley of Ben-hinnom, but the Valley of Slaughter. 
<a id="19-7"></a> <b>7</b> And in this place I will ruin the plans of Judah and Jerusalem. I will make them fall by the sword before their enemies, by the hands of those who seek their lives, and I will give their carcasses as food to the birds of the air and the beasts of the earth.
</p>

<p>
<a id="19-8"></a> <b>8</b> I will make this city a desolation and an object of scorn. All who pass by will be appalled and will scoff at all her wounds.

</p>

<p>
<a id="19-12"></a> <b>12</b> This is what I will do to this place and to its residents, declares the LORD. I will make this city like Topheth.

<p>
<a id="25-1"></a> This is the word that came to Jeremiah concerning all the people of Judah in the fourth year of Jehoiakim son of Josiah king of Judah, which was the first year of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon. 
<a id="25-2"></a> <b>2</b> So the prophet Jeremiah spoke to all the people of Judah and all the residents of Jerusalem as follows:
</p>

<p>
<a id="25-3"></a> <b>3</b> “From the thirteenth year of Josiah son of Amon king of Judah until this very day&#x2014;twenty-three years&#x2014;the word of the LORD has come to me, and I have spoken to you again and again, but you have not listened. 
<a id="25-4"></a> <b>4</b> And the LORD has sent all His servants the prophets to you again and again, but you have not listened or inclined your ear to hear.
</p>

<p>
<a id="25-5"></a> <b>5</b> The prophets told you, ‘Turn now, each of you, from your evil ways and deeds, and you can dwell in the land that the LORD has given to you and your fathers forever and ever. 
<a id="25-6"></a> <b>6</b> Do not follow other gods to serve and worship them, and do not provoke Me to anger with the works of your hands. Then I will do you no harm.&rsquo;
</p>

<p>
7‘But to your own harm, you have not listened to Me,&rsquo; declares the LORD, ‘so you have provoked Me to anger with the works of your hands.&rsquo;
</p>

<p>
<a id="25-8"></a> <b>8</b> Therefore this is what the LORD of Hosts says: ‘Because you have not obeyed My words, 
<a id="25-9"></a> <b>9</b> behold, I will summon all the families of the north, declares the LORD, and I will send for My servant Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, whom I will bring against this land, against its residents, and against all the surrounding nations. So I will devote them to destruction and make them an object of horror and contempt, an everlasting desolation.
</p>

<p>
<a id="25-10"></a> <b>10</b> Moreover, I will banish from them the sounds of joy and gladness, the voices of the bride and bridegroom, the sound of the millstones, and the light of the lamp. 
<a id="25-11"></a> <b>11</b> And this whole land will become a desolate wasteland, and these nations will serve the king of Babylon for seventy years.
</p>

<p>
<a id="25-12"></a> <b>12</b> But when seventy years are complete, I will punish the king of Babylon and that nation, the land of the Chaldeans, for their guilt, declares the LORD, and I will make it an everlasting desolation.
</p>

<p>
<a id="25-13"></a> <b>13</b> I will bring upon that land all the words I have pronounced against it, all that is written in this book, which Jeremiah has prophesied against all the nations. 
<a id="25-14"></a> <b>14</b> For many nations and great kings will enslave them, and I will repay them according to their deeds and according to the work of their hands.&rsquo; ”

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org6999c7d">
<p>
<a id="25-15"></a> <b>15</b> This is what the LORD, the God of Israel, said to me: “Take from My hand this cup of the wine of wrath, and make all the nations to whom I send you drink from it. 
<a id="25-16"></a> <b>16</b> And they will drink and stagger and go out of their minds, because of the sword that I will send among them.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="25-17"></a> <b>17</b> So I took the cup from the LORD&rsquo;s hand and made all the nations drink from it, each one to whom the LORD had sent me, 
<a id="25-18"></a> <b>18</b> to make them a ruin, an object of horror and contempt and cursing, as they are to this day&#x2014;Jerusalem and the cities of Judah, its kings and officials; 
<a id="25-19"></a> <b>19</b> Pharaoh king of Egypt, his officials, his leaders, and all his people; 
<a id="25-20"></a> <b>20</b> all the mixed tribes; all the kings of Uz; all the kings of the Philistines: Ashkelon, Gaza, Ekron, and the remnant of Ashdod;

<a id="25-22"></a> <b>22</b> all the kings of Tyre and Sidon; the kings of the coastlands across the sea; 
<a id="25-23"></a> <b>23</b> Dedan, Tema, Buz, and all who cut the corners of their hair; 
<a id="25-24"></a> <b>24</b> all the kings of Arabia, and all the kings of the mixed tribes who dwell in the desert; 
<a id="25-25"></a> <b>25</b> all the kings of Zimri, Elam, and Media; 
<a id="25-26"></a> <b>26</b> all the kings of the north, both near and far, one after another&#x2014;all the kingdoms on the face of the earth. And after all of them, the king of Sheshach will drink it too.
</p>

<p>
<a id="25-27"></a> <b>27</b> “Then you are to tell them that this is what the LORD of Hosts, the God of Israel, says: ‘Drink, get drunk, and vomit. Fall down and never get up again, because of the sword I will send among you.&rsquo;
</p>

<p>
<a id="25-28"></a> <b>28</b> If they refuse to take the cup from your hand and drink it, you are to tell them that this is what the LORD of Hosts says: ‘You most certainly must drink it! 
<a id="25-29"></a> <b>29</b> For behold, I am beginning to bring disaster on the city that bears My Name, so how could you possibly go unpunished? You will not go unpunished, for I am calling down a sword upon all the inhabitants of the earth, declares the LORD of Hosts.&rsquo;
</p>

<p>
<a id="25-30"></a> <b>30</b> So you are to prophesy all these words against them and say to them:
</p>

<p>
‘The LORD will roar from on high;
</p>

<p>
He will raise His voice from His holy habitation.
</p>

<p>
He will roar loudly over His pasture;
</p>

<p>

<p>
He will call out with a shout

against all the inhabitants of the earth.
</p>

<p>
<a id="25-31"></a> <b>31</b> The tumult will resound to the ends of the earth
</p>

<p>
because the LORD brings a charge against the nations.
</p>

<p>
He brings judgment on all mankind
</p>

<p>
and puts the wicked to the sword,&rsquo; ”
</p>

<p>
declares the LORD.
</p>

<p>
<a id="25-32"></a> <b>32</b> This is what the LORD of Hosts says:
</p>

<p>
“Behold! Disaster is spreading
</p>

<p>
from nation to nation;
</p>

<p>
a mighty storm is rising
</p>

<p>
from the ends of the earth.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="25-33"></a> <b>33</b> Those slain by the LORD on that day will be spread from one end of the earth to the other. They will not be mourned, gathered, or buried. They will be like dung lying on the ground.

<p>
<a id="27-1"></a> At the beginning of the reign of Zedekiah son of Josiah king of Judah, this word came to Jeremiah from the LORD. 
<a id="27-2"></a> <b>2</b> This is what the LORD said to me:
</p>

<p>
“Make for yourself a yoke out of leather straps and put it on your neck. 
<a id="27-3"></a> <b>3</b> Send word to the kings of Edom, Moab, Ammon, Tyre, and Sidon through the envoys who have come to Jerusalem to Zedekiah king of Judah. 
<a id="27-4"></a> <b>4</b> Give them a message from the LORD of Hosts, the God of Israel, to relay to their masters:
</p>

<p>
<a id="27-5"></a> <b>5</b> By My great power and outstretched arm, I made the earth and the men and beasts on the face of it, and I give it to whom I please. 
<a id="27-6"></a> <b>6</b> So now I have placed all these lands under the authority of My servant Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon. I have even made the beasts of the field subject to him. 
<a id="27-7"></a> <b>7</b> All nations will serve him and his son and grandson, until the time of his own land comes; then many nations and great kings will enslave him.
</p>

<p>
<a id="27-8"></a> <b>8</b> As for the nation or kingdom that does not serve Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon and does not place its neck under his yoke, I will punish that nation by sword and famine and plague, declares the LORD, until I have destroyed it by his hand.
</p>

<p>
<a id="27-9"></a> <b>9</b> But as for you, do not listen to your prophets, your diviners, your interpreters of dreams, your mediums, or your sorcerers who declare, ‘You will not serve the king of Babylon.&rsquo; 
<a id="27-10"></a> <b>10</b> For they prophesy to you a lie that will serve to remove you from your land; I will banish you and you will perish. 
<a id="27-11"></a> <b>11</b> But the nation that will put its neck under the yoke of the king of Babylon and serve him, I will leave in its own land, to cultivate it and reside in it, declares the LORD.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="27-12"></a> <b>12</b> And to Zedekiah king of Judah I spoke the same message: “Put your necks under the yoke of the king of Babylon; serve him and his people, and live! 
<a id="27-13"></a> <b>13</b> Why should you and your people die by sword and famine and plague, as the LORD has decreed against any nation that does not serve the king of Babylon?
</p>

<p>
<a id="27-14"></a> <b>14</b> Do not listen to the words of the prophets who say, ‘You must not serve the king of Babylon,&rsquo; for they are prophesying to you a lie. 
<a id="27-15"></a> <b>15</b> For I have not sent them, declares the LORD, and yet they are prophesying falsely in My name; therefore I will banish you, and you will perish&#x2014;you and the prophets who prophesy to you.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="27-16"></a> <b>16</b> Then I said to the priests and to all this people, “This is what the LORD says: Do not listen to the words of your prophets who prophesy to you, saying, ‘Look, very soon now the articles from the house of the LORD will be brought back from Babylon.&rsquo; They are prophesying to you a lie. 
<a id="27-17"></a> <b>17</b> Do not listen to them. Serve the king of Babylon and live! Why should this city become a ruin?
</p>

<p>
<a id="27-18"></a> <b>18</b> If they are indeed prophets and the word of the LORD is with them, let them now plead with the LORD of Hosts that the articles remaining in the house of the LORD, in the palace of the king of Judah, and in Jerusalem, not be taken to Babylon.
</p>

<p>
<a id="27-19"></a> <b>19</b> For this is what the LORD of Hosts says about the pillars, the sea, the bases, and the rest of the articles that remain in this city, 
<a id="27-20"></a> <b>20</b> which Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon did not take when he carried Jeconiah son of Jehoiakim king of Judah into exile from Jerusalem to Babylon, along with all the nobles of Judah and Jerusalem. 
<a id="27-21"></a> <b>21</b> Yes, this is what the LORD of Hosts, the God of Israel, says about the articles that remain in the house of the LORD, in the palace of the king of Judah, and in Jerusalem: 22‘They will be carried to Babylon and will remain there until the day I attend to them again,&rsquo; declares the LORD. ‘Then I will bring them back and restore them to this place.&rsquo; ”

</p>

<p>
<a id="28-1"></a> In the fifth month of that same year, the fourth year, near the beginning of the reign of King Zedekiah of Judah, the prophet Hananiah son of Azzur, who was from Gibeon, said to me in the house of the LORD in the presence of the priests and all the people:
<a id="28-2"></a> <b>2</b> “This is what the LORD of Hosts, the God of Israel, says: ‘I have broken the yoke of the king of Babylon. 
<a id="28-3"></a> <b>3</b> Within two years I will restore to this place all the articles of the house of the LORD that Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon removed from here and carried to Babylon. 
<a id="28-4"></a> <b>4</b> And I will restore to this place Jeconiah son of Jehoiakim king of Judah, along with all the exiles from Judah who went to Babylon,&rsquo; declares the LORD, ‘for I will break the yoke of the king of Babylon.&rsquo; ”
</p>

<p>
<a id="28-5"></a> <b>5</b> Then the prophet Jeremiah replied to the prophet Hananiah in the presence of the priests and all the people who were standing in the house of the LORD.
<a id="28-6"></a> <b>6</b> “Amen!” Jeremiah said. “May the LORD do so! May the LORD fulfill the words you have prophesied, and may He restore the articles of His house and all the exiles back to this place from Babylon.
</p>

<p>
<a id="28-7"></a> <b>7</b> Nevertheless, listen now to this message I am speaking in your hearing and in the hearing of all the people. 
<a id="28-8"></a> <b>8</b> The prophets of old who preceded you and me prophesied war, disaster, and plague against many lands and great kingdoms. 
<a id="28-9"></a> <b>9</b> As for the prophet who prophesies peace, only if the word of the prophet comes true will the prophet be recognized as one the LORD has truly sent.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="28-10"></a> <b>10</b> Then the prophet Hananiah took the yoke off the neck of Jeremiah the prophet and broke it. 
<a id="28-11"></a> <b>11</b> And in the presence of all the people Hananiah proclaimed, “This is what the LORD says: ‘In this way, within two years I will break the yoke of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon off the neck of all the nations.&rsquo; ”
</p>

<p>
At this, Jeremiah the prophet went on his way. 
<a id="28-12"></a> <b>12</b> But shortly after Hananiah the prophet had broken the yoke off his neck, the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah:
<a id="28-13"></a> <b>13</b> “Go and tell Hananiah that this is what the LORD says: ‘You have broken a yoke of wood, but in its place you have fashioned a yoke of iron.&rsquo;
</p>

<p>
<a id="28-14"></a> <b>14</b> For this is what the LORD of Hosts, the God of Israel, says: ‘I have put a yoke of iron on the neck of all these nations to make them serve Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and they will serve him. I have even given him control of the beasts of the field.&rsquo; ”
</p>

<p>
<a id="28-15"></a> <b>15</b> Then the prophet Jeremiah said to the prophet Hananiah, “Listen, Hananiah! The LORD did not send you, but you have persuaded this people to trust in a lie. 
<a id="28-16"></a> <b>16</b> Therefore this is what the LORD says: ‘I am about to remove you from the face of the earth. You will die this year because you have preached rebellion against the LORD.&rsquo; ”

<a id="29-5"></a> <b>5</b> “Build houses and settle down. Plant gardens and eat their produce. 
<a id="29-6"></a> <b>6</b> Take wives and have sons and daughters. Take wives for your sons and give your daughters in marriage, so that they too may have sons and daughters. Multiply there; do not decrease. 
<a id="29-7"></a> <b>7</b> Seek the prosperity of the city to which I have sent you as exiles. Pray to the LORD on its behalf, for if it prospers, you too will prosper.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="29-8"></a> <b>8</b> For this is what the LORD of Hosts, the God of Israel, says: “Do not be deceived by the prophets and diviners among you, and do not listen to the dreams you elicit from them. 
<a id="29-9"></a> <b>9</b> For they are falsely prophesying to you in My name; I have not sent them, declares the LORD.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="29-10"></a> <b>10</b> For this is what the LORD says: “When Babylon&rsquo;s seventy years are complete, I will attend to you and confirm My promise to restore you to this place. 
<a id="29-11"></a> <b>11</b> For I know the plans I have for you, declares the LORD, plans to prosper you and not to harm you, to give you a future and a hope. 
<a id="29-12"></a> <b>12</b> Then you will call upon Me and come and pray to Me, and I will listen to you. 
<a id="29-13"></a> <b>13</b> You will seek Me and find Me when you search for Me with all your heart. 
<a id="29-14"></a> <b>14</b> I will be found by you, declares the LORD, and I will restore you from captivity and gather you from all the nations and places to which I have banished you, declares the LORD. I will restore you to the place from which I sent you into exile.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="29-15"></a> <b>15</b> Because you may say, “The LORD has raised up for us prophets in Babylon,” 
<a id="29-16"></a> <b>16</b> this is what the LORD says about the king who sits on David&rsquo;s throne and all the people who remain in this city, your brothers who did not go with you into exile&#x2014; 
<a id="29-17"></a> <b>17</b> this is what the LORD of Hosts says:
</p>

<p>
“I will send against them sword and famine and plague, and I will make them like rotten figs, so bad they cannot be eaten. 
<a id="29-18"></a> <b>18</b> I will pursue them with sword and famine and plague. I will make them a horror to all the kingdoms of the earth&#x2014;a curse, a desolation, and an object of scorn and reproach among all the nations to which I banish them. 
<a id="29-19"></a> <b>19</b> I will do this because they have not listened to My words, declares the LORD, which I sent to them again and again through My servants the prophets. And neither have you exiles listened, declares the LORD.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="29-20"></a> <b>20</b> So hear the word of the LORD, all you exiles I have sent away from Jerusalem to Babylon. 
<a id="29-21"></a> <b>21</b> This is what the LORD of Hosts, the God of Israel, says about Ahab son of Kolaiah and Zedekiah son of Maaseiah, who are prophesying to you lies in My name: “I will deliver them to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and he will kill them before your very eyes. 
<a id="29-22"></a> <b>22</b> Because of them, all the exiles of Judah who are in Babylon will use this curse: ‘May the LORD make you like Zedekiah and Ahab, whom the king of Babylon roasted in the fire!&rsquo; 
<a id="29-23"></a> <b>23</b> For they have committed an outrage in Israel by committing adultery with the wives of their neighbors and speaking lies in My name, which I did not command them to do. I am He who knows, and I am a witness, declares the LORD.”

<p>
<a id="32-1"></a> This is the word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD in the tenth year of Zedekiah king of Judah, which was the eighteenth year of Nebuchadnezzar. 
<a id="32-2"></a> <b>2</b> At that time the army of the king of Babylon was besieging Jerusalem, and Jeremiah the prophet was imprisoned in the courtyard of the guard, which was in the palace of the king of Judah.
</p>

<p>
<a id="32-3"></a> <b>3</b> For Zedekiah king of Judah had imprisoned him, saying: “Why are you prophesying like this? You claim that the LORD says, ‘Behold, I am about to deliver this city into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he will capture it. 
<a id="32-4"></a> <b>4</b> Zedekiah king of Judah will not escape from the hands of the Chaldeans, but he will surely be delivered into the hand of the king of Babylon, and will speak with him face to face and see him eye to eye. 
<a id="32-5"></a> <b>5</b> He will take Zedekiah to Babylon, where he will stay until I attend to him, declares the LORD. If you fight against the Chaldeans, you will not succeed.&rsquo; ”
</p>

<p>
<a id="32-6"></a> <b>6</b> Jeremiah replied, “The word of the LORD came to me, saying: 
<a id="32-7"></a> <b>7</b> Behold! Hanamel, the son of your uncle Shallum, is coming to you to say, ‘Buy for yourself my field in Anathoth, for you have the right of redemption to buy it.&rsquo; 
<a id="32-8"></a> <b>8</b> Then, as the LORD had said, my cousin Hanamel came to me in the courtyard of the guard and urged me, ‘Please buy my field in Anathoth in the land of Benjamin, for you own the right of inheritance and redemption. Buy it for yourself.&rsquo; ”
</p>

<p>
Then I knew that this was the word of the LORD.
</p>

<p>
<a id="32-9"></a> <b>9</b> So I bought the field in Anathoth from my cousin Hanamel, and I weighed out seventeen shekels of silver. 
<a id="32-10"></a> <b>10</b> I signed and sealed the deed, called in witnesses, and weighed out the silver on the scales. 
<a id="32-11"></a> <b>11</b> Then I took the deed of purchase&#x2014;the sealed copy with its terms and conditions, as well as the open copy&#x2014; 
<a id="32-12"></a> <b>12</b> and I gave this deed to Baruch son of Neriah, the son of Mahseiah, in the sight of my cousin Hanamel and the witnesses who were signing the purchase agreement and all the Jews sitting in the courtyard of the guard.
</p>

<p>
<a id="32-13"></a> <b>13</b> In their sight I instructed Baruch,
<a id="32-14"></a> <b>14</b> “This is what the LORD of Hosts, the God of Israel, says: Take these deeds&#x2014;both the sealed copy and the open copy of the deed of purchase&#x2014;and put them in a clay jar to preserve them for a long time. 
<a id="32-15"></a> <b>15</b> For this is what the LORD of Hosts, the God of Israel, says: Houses, fields, and vineyards will again be bought in this land.”

</p>

<p>
<a id="32-23"></a> <b>23</b> They came in and possessed it, but they did not obey Your voice or walk in Your law. They failed to perform all that You commanded them to do, and so You have brought upon them all this disaster. 
<a id="32-24"></a> <b>24</b> See how the siege ramps are mounted against the city to capture it. And by sword and famine and plague, the city has been given into the hands of the Chaldeans who are fighting against it. What You have spoken has happened, as You now see!
</p>

<p>
<a id="32-25"></a> <b>25</b> Yet You, O Lord GOD, have said to me, ‘Buy for yourself the field with silver and call in witnesses, even though the city has been delivered into the hands of the Chaldeans!&rsquo; ”

<a id="32-28"></a> <b>28</b> Therefore this is what the LORD says: Behold, I am about to deliver this city into the hands of the Chaldeans and of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, who will capture it.

<p>

<a id="33-10"></a> <b>10</b> This is what the LORD says: In this place you say is a wasteland without man or beast, in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem that are deserted&#x2014;inhabited by neither man nor beast&#x2014;there will be heard again

<a id="34-12"></a> <b>12</b> Then the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah from the LORD, saying,

<p>
<a id="36-1"></a> In the fourth year of Jehoiakim son of Josiah king of Judah, this word came to Jeremiah from the LORD:
<a id="36-2"></a> <b>2</b> “Take a scroll and write on it all the words I have spoken to you concerning Israel, Judah, and all the nations, from the day I first spoke to you during the reign of Josiah until today. 
<a id="36-3"></a> <b>3</b> Perhaps when the people of Judah hear about all the calamity I plan to bring upon them, each of them will turn from his wicked way. Then I will forgive their iniquity and their sin.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="36-4"></a> <b>4</b> So Jeremiah called Baruch son of Neriah, and at the dictation of Jeremiah, Baruch wrote on a scroll all the words that the LORD had spoken to Jeremiah.
</p>

<p>
<a id="36-5"></a> <b>5</b> Then Jeremiah commanded Baruch, “I am restricted; I cannot enter the house of the LORD; 
<a id="36-6"></a> <b>6</b> so you are to go to the house of the LORD on a day of fasting, and in the hearing of the people you are to read the words of the LORD from the scroll you have written at my dictation. Read them in the hearing of all the people of Judah who are coming from their cities.
</p>

<p>
<a id="36-7"></a> <b>7</b> Perhaps they will bring their petition before the LORD, and each one will turn from his wicked way; for great are the anger and fury that the LORD has pronounced against this people.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="36-8"></a> <b>8</b> So Baruch son of Neriah did everything that Jeremiah the prophet had commanded him. In the house of the LORD he read the words of the LORD from the scroll.
</p>

<p>
<a id="36-9"></a> <b>9</b> Now in the ninth month of the fifth year of Jehoiakim son of Josiah king of Judah, a fast before the LORD was proclaimed to all the people of Jerusalem and all who had come there from the cities of Judah. 
<a id="36-10"></a> <b>10</b> From the chamber of Gemariah son of Shaphan the scribe, which was in the upper courtyard at the opening of the New Gate of the house of the LORD, Baruch read from the scroll the words of Jeremiah in the hearing of all the people.

<a id="36-12"></a> <b>12</b> he went down to the scribe&rsquo;s chamber in the king&rsquo;s palace, where all the officials were sitting: Elishama the scribe, Delaiah son of Shemaiah, Elnathan son of Achbor, Gemariah son of Shaphan, Zedekiah son of Hananiah, and all the other officials.

<p>
<a id="36-14"></a> <b>14</b> Then all the officials sent word to Baruch through Jehudi son of Nethaniah, the son of Shelemiah, the son of Cushi, saying, “Bring the scroll that you read in the hearing of the people, and come here.”
</p>

<p>
So Baruch son of Neriah took the scroll and went to them.
</p>

<p>
<a id="36-15"></a> <b>15</b> “Please sit down,” they said, “and read it in our hearing.”

So Baruch read it in their hearing.

<p>
<a id="36-16"></a> <b>16</b> When they had heard all these words, they turned to one another in fear and said to Baruch, “Surely we must report all these words to the king.”

<p>
<a id="36-17"></a> <b>17</b> “Tell us now,” they asked Baruch, “how did you write all these words? Was it at Jeremiah&rsquo;s dictation?”
</p>

<p>
<a id="36-18"></a> <b>18</b> “It was at his dictation,” Baruch replied. “He recited all these words to me and I wrote them in ink on the scroll.”

<a id="36-21"></a> <b>21</b> Then the king sent Jehudi to get the scroll, and he took it from the chamber of Elishama the scribe. And Jehudi read it in the hearing of the king and all the officials who were standing beside him.

<p>
<a id="36-22"></a> <b>22</b> Since it was the ninth month, the king was sitting in his winter quarters with a fire burning before him.

<a id="36-24"></a> <b>24</b> Yet in hearing all these words, the king and his servants did not become frightened or tear their garments. 
<a id="36-25"></a> <b>25</b> Even though Elnathan, Delaiah, and Gemariah urged the king not to burn the scroll, he would not listen to them. 
<a id="36-26"></a> <b>26</b> Instead, the king commanded Jerahmeel, a son of the king, as well as Seraiah son of Azriel and Shelemiah son of Abdeel, to seize Baruch the scribe and Jeremiah the prophet. But the LORD had hidden them.

<a id="37-2"></a> <b>2</b> But he and his officers and the people of the land refused to obey the words that the LORD had spoken through Jeremiah the prophet.
</p>

<p>
<a id="37-3"></a> <b>3</b> Yet King Zedekiah sent Jehucal son of Shelemiah and Zephaniah the priest, the son of Maaseiah, to Jeremiah the prophet with the message, “Please pray to the LORD our God for us!”

<a id="37-11"></a> <b>11</b> When the Chaldean army withdrew from Jerusalem for fear of Pharaoh&rsquo;s army, 
<a id="37-12"></a> <b>12</b> Jeremiah started to leave Jerusalem to go to the land of Benjamin to claim his portion there among the people. 
<a id="37-13"></a> <b>13</b> But when he reached the Gate of Benjamin, the captain of the guard, whose name was Irijah son of Shelemiah, the son of Hananiah, seized him and said, “You are deserting to the Chaldeans!”
</p>

<p>
<a id="37-14"></a> <b>14</b> “That is a lie,” Jeremiah replied. “I am not deserting to the Chaldeans!”
</p>

<p>
But Irijah would not listen to him; instead, he arrested Jeremiah and took him to the officials.
</p>

<p>
<a id="37-15"></a> <b>15</b> The officials were angry with Jeremiah, and they beat him and placed him in jail in the house of Jonathan the scribe, for it had been made into a prison.
</p>

<p>
<a id="37-16"></a> <b>16</b> So Jeremiah went into a cell in the dungeon and remained there a long time.
</p>

<p>
<a id="37-17"></a> <b>17</b> Later, King Zedekiah sent for Jeremiah and received him in his palace, where he asked him privately, “Is there a word from the LORD?”
</p>

<p>
“There is,” Jeremiah replied. “You will be delivered into the hand of the king of Babylon.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="37-18"></a> <b>18</b> Then Jeremiah asked King Zedekiah, “How have I sinned against you or your servants or these people, that you have put me in prison? 
<a id="37-19"></a> <b>19</b> Where are your prophets who prophesied to you, claiming, ‘The king of Babylon will not come against you or this land&rsquo;? 
<a id="37-20"></a> <b>20</b> But now please listen, O my lord the king. May my petition come before you. Do not send me back to the house of Jonathan the scribe, or I will die there.”

<p>
<a id="37-21"></a> <b>21</b> So King Zedekiah gave orders for Jeremiah to be placed in the courtyard of the guard and given a loaf of bread daily from the street of the bakers, until all the bread in the city was gone. So Jeremiah remained in the courtyard of the guard.

<p>
<a id="38-1"></a> Now Shephatiah son of Mattan, Gedaliah son of Pashhur, Jucal son of Shelemiah, and Pashhur son of Malchijah heard that Jeremiah had been telling all the people:
<a id="38-2"></a> <b>2</b> “This is what the LORD says: Whoever stays in this city will die by sword and famine and plague, but whoever surrenders to the Chaldeans will live; he will retain his life like a spoil of war, and he will live. 
<a id="38-3"></a> <b>3</b> This is what the LORD says: This city will surely be delivered into the hands of the army of the king of Babylon, and he will capture it.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="38-4"></a> <b>4</b> Then the officials said to the king, “This man ought to die, for he is discouraging the warriors who remain in this city, as well as all the people, by speaking such words to them; this man is not seeking the well-being of these people, but their ruin.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="38-5"></a> <b>5</b> “Here he is,” replied King Zedekiah. “He is in your hands, since the king can do nothing to stop you.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="38-6"></a> <b>6</b> So they took Jeremiah and dropped him into the cistern of Malchiah, the king&rsquo;s son, which was in the courtyard of the guard. They lowered Jeremiah with ropes into the cistern, which had no water but only mud, and Jeremiah sank down into the mud.
</p>

<p>
<a id="38-7"></a> <b>7</b> Now Ebed-melech the Cushite, a court official in the royal palace, heard that Jeremiah had been put into the cistern. While the king was sitting at the Gate of Benjamin, 
<a id="38-8"></a> <b>8</b> Ebed-melech went out from the king&rsquo;s palace and said to the king,
<a id="38-9"></a> <b>9</b> “My lord the king, these men have acted wickedly in all that they have done to Jeremiah the prophet. They have dropped him into the cistern, where he will starve to death, for there is no more bread in the city.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="38-10"></a> <b>10</b> So the king commanded Ebed-melech the Cushite, “Take thirty men from here with you and pull Jeremiah the prophet out of the cistern before he dies.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="38-11"></a> <b>11</b> Then Ebed-melech took the men with him and went to the king&rsquo;s palace, to a place below the storehouse. From there he took old rags and worn-out clothes and lowered them with ropes to Jeremiah in the cistern.
</p>

<p>
<a id="38-12"></a> <b>12</b> Ebed-melech the Cushite cried out to Jeremiah, “Put these worn-out rags and clothes under your arms to pad the ropes.” Jeremiah did so, 
<a id="38-13"></a> <b>13</b> and they pulled him up with the ropes and lifted him out of the cistern. And Jeremiah remained in the courtyard of the guard.
</p>

<p>
<a id="38-14"></a> <b>14</b> Then King Zedekiah sent for Jeremiah the prophet and received him at the third entrance to the house of the LORD. “I am going to ask you something,” said the king to Jeremiah. “Do not hide anything from me.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="38-15"></a> <b>15</b> “If I tell you,” Jeremiah replied, “you will surely put me to death. And even if I give you advice, you will not listen to me.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="38-16"></a> <b>16</b> But King Zedekiah swore secretly to Jeremiah, “As surely as the LORD lives, who has given us this life, I will not kill you, nor will I deliver you into the hands of these men who are seeking your life.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="38-17"></a> <b>17</b> Then Jeremiah said to Zedekiah, “This is what the LORD God of Hosts, the God of Israel, says: ‘If you indeed surrender to the officers of the king of Babylon, then you will live, this city will not be burned down, and you and your household will survive. 
<a id="38-18"></a> <b>18</b> But if you do not surrender to the officers of the king of Babylon, then this city will be delivered into the hands of the Chaldeans. They will burn it down, and you yourself will not escape their grasp.&rsquo; ”
</p>

<p>
<a id="38-19"></a> <b>19</b> But King Zedekiah said to Jeremiah, “I am afraid of the Jews who have deserted to the Chaldeans, for the Chaldeans may deliver me into their hands to abuse me.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="38-20"></a> <b>20</b> “They will not hand you over,” Jeremiah replied. “Obey the voice of the LORD in what I am telling you, that it may go well with you and you may live. 
<a id="38-21"></a> <b>21</b> But if you refuse to surrender, this is the word that the LORD has shown me: 
<a id="38-22"></a> <b>22</b> All the women who remain in the palace of the king of Judah will be brought out to the officials of the king of Babylon, and those women will say:
</p>

<p>
‘They misled you and overcame you&#x2014;
</p>

<p>
those trusted friends of yours.
</p>

<p>
Your feet sank into the mire,
</p>

<p>
and they deserted you.&rsquo;
</p>

<p>
<a id="38-23"></a> <b>23</b> All your wives and children will be brought out to the Chaldeans. And you yourself will not escape their grasp, for you will be seized by the king of Babylon, and this city will be burned down.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="38-24"></a> <b>24</b> Then Zedekiah warned Jeremiah, “Do not let anyone know about this conversation, or you will die. 
<a id="38-25"></a> <b>25</b> If the officials hear that I have spoken with you, and they come and demand of you, ‘Tell us what you said to the king and what he said to you; do not hide it from us, or we will kill you,&rsquo; 
<a id="38-26"></a> <b>26</b> then tell them, ‘I was presenting to the king my petition that he not return me to the house of Jonathan to die there.&rsquo; ”
</p>

<p>
<a id="38-27"></a> <b>27</b> When all the officials came to Jeremiah and questioned him, he relayed to them the exact words the king had commanded him to say. So they said no more to him, for no one had overheard the conversation.

<p>
<a id="40-1"></a> This is the word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD after Nebuzaradan captain of the guard had released him at Ramah, having found him bound in chains among all the captives of Jerusalem and Judah who were being exiled to Babylon.
</p>

<p>
<a id="40-2"></a> <b>2</b> The captain of the guard found Jeremiah and said to him, “The LORD your God decreed this disaster on this place, 
<a id="40-3"></a> <b>3</b> and now the LORD has fulfilled it; He has done just as He said. Because you people have sinned against the LORD and have not obeyed His voice, this thing has happened to you. 
<a id="40-4"></a> <b>4</b> But now, behold, I am freeing you today from the chains that were on your wrists. If it pleases you to come with me to Babylon, then come, and I will take care of you. But if it seems wrong to you to come with me to Babylon, go no farther. Look, the whole land is before you. Wherever it seems good and right to you, go there.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="40-5"></a> <b>5</b> But before Jeremiah turned to go, Nebuzaradan added, “Return to Gedaliah son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, whom the king of Babylon has appointed over the cities of Judah, and stay with him among the people, or go anywhere else that seems right.” Then the captain of the guard gave him a ration and a gift and released him.
</p>

<p>
<a id="40-6"></a> <b>6</b> So Jeremiah went to Gedaliah son of Ahikam at Mizpah and stayed with him among the people who were left in the land.

<a id="40-8"></a> <b>8</b> they came to Gedaliah at Mizpah&#x2014;Ishmael son of Nethaniah, Johanan and Jonathan the sons of Kareah, Seraiah son of Tanhumeth, the sons of Ephai the Netophathite, and Jezaniah son of the Maacathite&#x2014;they and their men.

<p>
<a id="40-9"></a> <b>9</b> Gedaliah son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, swore an oath to them and their men, assuring them, “Do not be afraid to serve the Chaldeans. Live in the land and serve the king of Babylon, and it will go well with you. 
<a id="40-10"></a> <b>10</b> As for me, I will stay in Mizpah to represent you before the Chaldeans who come to us. As for you, gather wine grapes, summer fruit, and oil, place them in your storage jars, and live in the cities you have taken.”

<p>
<a id="41-1"></a> In the seventh month, Ishmael son of Nethaniah, the son of Elishama, who was a member of the royal family and one of the king&rsquo;s chief officers, came with ten men to Gedaliah son of Ahikam at Mizpah, and they ate a meal together there. 
<a id="41-2"></a> <b>2</b> Then Ishmael son of Nethaniah and the ten men who were with him got up and struck down Gedaliah son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, with the sword, killing the one whom the king of Babylon had appointed to govern the land. 
<a id="41-3"></a> <b>3</b> Ishmael also killed all the Jews who were with Gedaliah at Mizpah, as well as the Chaldean soldiers who were there.
</p>

<p>
<a id="41-4"></a> <b>4</b> On the second day after the murder of Gedaliah, when no one yet knew about it, 
<a id="41-5"></a> <b>5</b> eighty men who had shaved off their beards, torn their garments, and cut themselves came from Shechem, Shiloh, and Samaria, carrying grain offerings and frankincense for the house of the LORD. 
<a id="41-6"></a> <b>6</b> And Ishmael son of Nethaniah went out from Mizpah to meet them, weeping as he went.
</p>

<p>
When Ishmael encountered the men, he said, “Come to Gedaliah son of Ahikam.” 
<a id="41-7"></a> <b>7</b> And when they came into the city, Ishmael son of Nethaniah and the men with him slaughtered them and threw them into a cistern.
</p>

<p>
<a id="41-8"></a> <b>8</b> But ten of the men among them said to Ishmael, “Do not kill us, for we have hidden treasure in the field&#x2014;wheat, barley, oil, and honey!” So he refrained from killing them with the others.
</p>

<p>
<a id="41-9"></a> <b>9</b> Now the cistern into which Ishmael had thrown all the bodies of the men he had struck down along with Gedaliah was a large one that King Asa had made for fear of Baasha king of Israel. Ishmael son of Nethaniah filled it with the slain.
</p>

<p>
<a id="41-10"></a> <b>10</b> Then Ishmael took captive all the remnant of the people of Mizpah&#x2014;the daughters of the king along with all the others who remained in Mizpah&#x2014;over whom Nebuzaradan captain of the guard had appointed Gedaliah son of Ahikam. Ishmael son of Nethaniah took them captive and set off to cross over to the Ammonites.

<a id="41-17"></a> <b>17</b> And they went and stayed in Geruth Chimham, near Bethlehem, in order to proceed into Egypt

<a id="42-1"></a> Then all the commanders of the forces, along with Johanan son of Kareah, Jezaniah son of Hoshaiah, and all the people from the least to the greatest, approached

</p>

<p>
<a id="42-5"></a> <b>5</b> Then they said to Jeremiah, “May the LORD be a true and faithful witness against us if we do not act upon every word that the LORD your God sends you to tell us.

<p>
<a id="42-7"></a> <b>7</b> After ten days the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah,

</p>

<p>
<a id="42-9"></a> <b>9</b> Jeremiah told them, “Thus says the LORD, the God of Israel, to whom you sent me to present your petition: 10‘If you will indeed stay in this land, then I will build you up and not tear you down; I will plant you and not uproot you, for I will relent of the disaster I have brought upon you.

<a id="42-14"></a> <b>14</b> and if you say, ‘No, but we will go to the land of Egypt and live there, where we will not see war or hear the sound of the ram&rsquo;s horn or hunger for bread,&rsquo; 
<a id="42-15"></a> <b>15</b> then hear the word of the LORD, O remnant of Judah! This is what the LORD of Hosts, the God of Israel, says: ‘If you are determined to go to Egypt and reside there, 
<a id="42-16"></a> <b>16</b> then the sword you fear will overtake you there, and the famine you dread will follow on your heels into Egypt, and you will die there. 
<a id="42-17"></a> <b>17</b> So all who resolve to go to Egypt to reside there will die by sword and famine and plague. Not one of them will survive or escape the disaster I will bring upon them.&rsquo;

<p>
<a id="42-18"></a> <b>18</b> For this is what the LORD of Hosts, the God of Israel, says: ‘Just as My anger and wrath were poured out on the residents of Jerusalem, so will My wrath be poured out on you if you go to Egypt.

<p>

<p>
<a id="43-4"></a> <b>4</b> So Johanan son of Kareah and all the commanders of the forces disobeyed the command of the LORD to stay in the land of Judah. 
<a id="43-5"></a> <b>5</b> Instead, Johanan son of Kareah and all the commanders of the forces took the whole remnant of Judah, those who had returned to the land of Judah from all the nations to which they had been scattered,

<a id="43-10"></a> <b>10</b> Then tell them that this is what the LORD of Hosts, the God of Israel, says: ‘I will send for My servant Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and I will set his throne over these stones that I have embedded, and he will spread his royal pavilion over them. 
<a id="43-11"></a> <b>11</b> He will come and strike down the land of Egypt, bringing death to those destined for death, captivity to those destined for captivity, and the sword to those destined for the sword.

<a id="44-1"></a> This is the word that came to Jeremiah concerning all the Jews living in the land of Egypt&#x2014;in Migdol, Tahpanhes, and Memphis&#x2014;and in the land of Pathros:
<a id="44-2"></a> <b>2</b> “This is what the LORD of Hosts, the God of Israel, says: You have seen all the disaster that I brought against Jerusalem and all the cities of Judah; and behold, they lie today in ruins and desolation 
<a id="44-3"></a> <b>3</b> because of the evil they have done.
</p>

<p>
They provoked Me to anger by continuing to burn incense and to serve other gods that neither they nor you nor your fathers ever knew. 
<a id="44-4"></a> <b>4</b> Yet I sent you all My servants the prophets again and again, saying: ‘Do not do this detestable thing that I hate.&rsquo;
</p>

<p>
<a id="44-5"></a> <b>5</b> But they did not listen or incline their ears; they did not turn from their wickedness or stop burning incense to other gods. 
<a id="44-6"></a> <b>6</b> Therefore My wrath and anger poured out and burned in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem, so that they have become the desolate ruin they are today.
</p>

<p>
<a id="44-7"></a> <b>7</b> So now, this is what the LORD God of Hosts, the God of Israel, says: Why are you doing such great harm to yourselves by cutting off from Judah man and woman, child and infant, leaving yourselves without a remnant? 
<a id="44-8"></a> <b>8</b> Why are you provoking Me to anger by the work of your hands by burning incense to other gods in the land of Egypt, where you have gone to reside?
</p>

<p>
As a result, you will be cut off and will become an object of cursing and reproach among all the nations of the earth. 
<a id="44-9"></a> <b>9</b> Have you forgotten the wickedness of your fathers and of the kings of Judah and their wives, as well as the wickedness that you and your wives committed in the land of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem? 
<a id="44-10"></a> <b>10</b> To this day they have not humbled themselves or shown reverence, nor have they followed My instruction or the statutes that I set before you and your fathers.
</p>

<p>
<a id="44-11"></a> <b>11</b> Therefore this is what the LORD of Hosts, the God of Israel, says: I will set My face to bring disaster and to cut off all Judah. 
<a id="44-12"></a> <b>12</b> And I will take away the remnant of Judah who have resolved to go to the land of Egypt to reside there; they will meet their end. They will all fall by the sword or be consumed by famine. From the least to the greatest, they will die by sword or famine; and they will become an object of cursing and horror, of vilification and reproach.
</p>

<p>
<a id="44-13"></a> <b>13</b> I will punish those who live in the land of Egypt, just as I punished Jerusalem, by sword and famine and plague, 
<a id="44-14"></a> <b>14</b> so that none of the remnant of Judah who have gone to reside in Egypt will escape or survive to return to the land of Judah, where they long to return and live; for none will return except a few fugitives.”

At that time we had plenty of food and good things, and we saw no disaster.

<p>
<a id="44-24"></a> <b>24</b> Then Jeremiah said to all the people, including all the women, “Hear the word of the LORD, all those of Judah who are in the land of Egypt.

<a id="44-27"></a> <b>27</b> I am watching over them for harm and not for good, and every man of Judah who is in the land of Egypt will meet his end by sword or famine, until they are finished off.

<p>
<a id="51-59"></a> <b>59</b> This is the message that Jeremiah the prophet gave to the quartermaster Seraiah son of Neriah, the son of Mahseiah, when he went to Babylon with King Zedekiah of Judah in the fourth year of Zedekiah&rsquo;s reign. 
<a id="51-60"></a> <b>60</b> Jeremiah had written on a single scroll about all the disaster that would come upon Babylon&#x2014;all these words that had been written concerning Babylon.
</p>

<p>
<a id="51-61"></a> <b>61</b> And Jeremiah said to Seraiah, “When you get to Babylon, see that you read all these words aloud, 
<a id="51-62"></a> <b>62</b> and say, ‘O LORD, You have promised to cut off this place so that no one will remain&#x2014;neither man nor beast. Indeed, it will be desolate forever.&rsquo;
</p>

<p>
<a id="51-63"></a> <b>63</b> When you finish reading this scroll, tie a stone to it and cast it into the Euphrates. 
<a id="51-64"></a> <b>64</b> Then you are to say, ‘In the same way Babylon will sink and never rise again, because of the disaster I will bring upon her. And her people will grow weary.&rsquo; ”

<a id="52-1"></a> Zedekiah was twenty-one years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem eleven years. His mother&rsquo;s name was Hamutal daughter of Jeremiah; she was from Libnah.
</p>

<p>
<a id="52-2"></a> <b>2</b> And Zedekiah did evil in the sight of the LORD, just as Jehoiakim had done. 
<a id="52-3"></a> <b>3</b> For because of the anger of the LORD, all this happened in Jerusalem and Judah, until He finally banished them from His presence.
</p>

<p>
And Zedekiah also rebelled against the king of Babylon.
</p>

<p>
<a id="52-4"></a> <b>4</b> So in the ninth year of Zedekiah&rsquo;s reign, on the tenth day of the tenth month, Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon marched against Jerusalem with his entire army. They encamped outside the city and built a siege wall all around it. 
<a id="52-5"></a> <b>5</b> And the city was kept under siege until King Zedekiah&rsquo;s eleventh year.
</p>

<p>
<a id="52-6"></a> <b>6</b> By the ninth day of the fourth month, the famine in the city was so severe that the people of the land had no food. 
<a id="52-7"></a> <b>7</b> Then the city was breached; and though the Chaldeans had surrounded the city, all the men of war fled the city by night by way of the gate between the two walls near the king&rsquo;s garden.
</p>

<p>
They headed toward the Arabah, 
<a id="52-8"></a> <b>8</b> but the army of the Chaldeans pursued the king and overtook Zedekiah in the plains of Jericho, and all his army was separated from him.
</p>

<p>
<a id="52-9"></a> <b>9</b> The Chaldeans seized the king and brought him up to the king of Babylon at Riblah in the land of Hamath, where he pronounced judgment on Zedekiah.
</p>

<p>
<a id="52-10"></a> <b>10</b> There at Riblah the king of Babylon slaughtered the sons of Zedekiah before his eyes, and he also killed all the officials of Judah. 
<a id="52-11"></a> <b>11</b> Then he put out Zedekiah&rsquo;s eyes, bound him with bronze shackles, and took him to Babylon, where he kept him in custody until his dying day.

<a id="52-14"></a> <b>14</b> And the whole army of the Chaldeans under the captain of the guard broke down all the walls around Jerusalem.
</p>

<p>
<a id="52-15"></a> <b>15</b> Then Nebuzaradan captain of the guard carried into exile some of the poorest people and those who remained in the city, along with the deserters who had defected to the king of Babylon and the rest of the craftsmen. 
<a id="52-16"></a> <b>16</b> But Nebuzaradan captain of the guard left behind some of the poorest of the land to tend the vineyards and fields.
</p>

<p>
<a id="52-17"></a> <b>17</b> Moreover, the Chaldeans broke up the bronze pillars and stands and the bronze Sea in the house of the LORD, and they carried all the bronze to Babylon. 
<a id="52-18"></a> <b>18</b> They also took away the pots, shovels, wick trimmers, sprinkling bowls, dishes, and all the articles of bronze used in the temple service. 
<a id="52-19"></a> <b>19</b> The captain of the guard also took away the basins, censers, sprinkling bowls, pots, lampstands, pans, and drink offering bowls&#x2014;anything made of pure gold or fine silver.

<p>
<a id="52-20"></a> <b>20</b> As for the two pillars, the Sea, the twelve bronze bulls under it, and the movable stands that King Solomon had made for the house of the LORD, the weight of the bronze from all these articles was beyond measure.

<a id="52-22"></a> <b>22</b> The bronze capital atop one pillar was five cubits high, with a network of bronze pomegranates all around. The second pillar, with its pomegranates, was similar. 
<a id="52-23"></a> <b>23</b> Each capital had ninety-six pomegranates on the sides, and a total of a hundred pomegranates were above the surrounding network.

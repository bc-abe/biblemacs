<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgee34b22">
<p>
<a id="1-6"></a> <b>6</b> There came a man who was sent from God. His name was John. 
<a id="1-7"></a> <b>7</b> He came as a witness to testify about the Light, so that through him everyone might believe. 
<a id="1-8"></a> <b>8</b> He himself was not the Light, but he came to testify about the Light.
</p>

<p>
<a id="1-9"></a> <b>9</b> The true Light who gives light to every man was coming into the world. 
<a id="1-10"></a> <b>10</b> He was in the world, and though the world was made through Him, the world did not recognize Him. 
<a id="1-11"></a> <b>11</b> He came to His own, and His own did not receive Him. 
<a id="1-12"></a> <b>12</b> But to all who did receive Him, to those who believed in His name, He gave the right to become children of God&#x2014; 
<a id="1-13"></a> <b>13</b> children born not of blood, nor of the desire or will of man, but born of God.

<a id="1-15"></a> <b>15</b> John testified concerning Him. He cried out, saying, “This is He of whom I said, ‘He who comes after me has surpassed me because He was before me.&rsquo; ”
</p>

<p>
<a id="1-16"></a> <b>16</b> From His fullness we have all received grace upon grace. 
<a id="1-17"></a> <b>17</b> For the law was given through Moses; grace and truth came through Jesus Christ. 
<a id="1-18"></a> <b>18</b> No one has ever seen God, but the one and only Son, who is Himself God and is at the Father&rsquo;s side, has made Him known.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org2ddba16">
<p>
<a id="1-19"></a> <b>19</b> And this was John&rsquo;s testimony when the Jews of Jerusalem sent priests and Levites to ask him, “Who are you?” 
<a id="1-20"></a> <b>20</b> He did not refuse to confess, but openly declared, “I am not the Christ.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="1-21"></a> <b>21</b> “Then who are you?” they inquired. “Are you Elijah?”
</p>

<p>
He said, “I am not.”
</p>

<p>
“Are you the Prophet?”
</p>

<p>
He answered, “No.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="1-22"></a> <b>22</b> So they said to him, “Who are you? We need an answer for those who sent us. What do you say about yourself?”
</p>

<p>
<a id="1-23"></a> <b>23</b> John replied in the words of Isaiah the prophet:
</p>

<p>
“I am a voice of one calling in the wilderness,
</p>

<p>
‘Make straight the way for the Lord.&rsquo; ”
</p>

<p>
<a id="1-24"></a> <b>24</b> Then the Pharisees who had been sent 
<a id="1-25"></a> <b>25</b> asked him, “Why then do you baptize, if you are not the Christ, nor Elijah, nor the Prophet?”
</p>

<p>
<a id="1-26"></a> <b>26</b> “I baptize with water,” John replied, “but among you stands One you do not know. 
<a id="1-27"></a> <b>27</b> He is the One who comes after me, the straps of whose sandals I am not worthy to untie.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="1-28"></a> <b>28</b> All this happened at Bethany beyond the Jordan, where John was baptizing.

<a id="1-29"></a> <b>29</b> The next day John saw Jesus coming toward him and said, “Look, the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world!

</p>

<p>
<a id="1-32"></a> <b>32</b> Then John testified, “I saw the Spirit descending from heaven like a dove and resting on Him. 
<a id="1-33"></a> <b>33</b> I myself did not know Him, but the One who sent me to baptize with water told me, ‘The man on whom you see the Spirit descend and rest is He who will baptize with the Holy Spirit.&rsquo;

<a id="1-35"></a> <b>35</b> The next day John was there again with two of his disciples. 
<a id="1-36"></a> <b>36</b> When he saw Jesus walking by, he said, “Look, the Lamb of God!” 
<a id="1-37"></a> <b>37</b> And when the two disciples heard him say this, they followed Jesus.
</p>

<p>
<a id="1-38"></a> <b>38</b> Jesus turned and saw them following. “What do you want?” He asked.
</p>

<p>
They said to Him, “Rabbi” (which means Teacher), “where are You staying?”
</p>

<p>
<a id="1-39"></a> <b>39</b> “Come and see,” He replied. So they went and saw where He was staying, and spent that day with Him. It was about the tenth hour.

<a id="1-43"></a> <b>43</b> The next day Jesus decided to set out for Galilee. Finding Philip, He told him, “Follow Me.” 
<a id="1-44"></a> <b>44</b> Now Philip was from Bethsaida, the same town as Andrew and Peter.
</p>

<p>
<a id="1-45"></a> <b>45</b> Philip found Nathanael and told him, “We have found the One Moses wrote about in the Law, the One the prophets foretold&#x2014;Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="1-46"></a> <b>46</b> “Can anything good come from Nazareth?” Nathanael asked.
</p>

<p>
“Come and see,” said Philip.
</p>

<p>
<a id="1-47"></a> <b>47</b> When Jesus saw Nathanael approaching, He said of him, “Here is a true Israelite, in whom there is no deceit.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="1-48"></a> <b>48</b> “How do You know me?” Nathanael asked.
</p>

<p>
Jesus replied, “Before Philip called you, I saw you under the fig tree.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="1-49"></a> <b>49</b> “Rabbi,” Nathanael answered, “You are the Son of God! You are the King of Israel!”

<p>
<a id="1-50"></a> <b>50</b> Jesus said to him, “Do you believe just because I told you I saw you under the fig tree? You will see greater things than these.”

</p>

<p>
<a id="2-1"></a> On the third day a wedding took place at Cana in Galilee. Jesus&rsquo; mother was there, 
<a id="2-2"></a> <b>2</b> and Jesus and His disciples had also been invited to the wedding. 
<a id="2-3"></a> <b>3</b> When the wine ran out, Jesus&rsquo; mother said to Him, “They have no more wine.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="2-4"></a> <b>4</b> “Woman, why does this concern us?” Jesus replied. “My hour has not yet come.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="2-5"></a> <b>5</b> His mother said to the servants, “Do whatever He tells you.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="2-6"></a> <b>6</b> Now six stone water jars had been set there for the Jewish rites of purification. Each could hold from twenty to thirty gallons. 
<a id="2-7"></a> <b>7</b> Jesus told the servants, “Fill the jars with water.”
</p>

<p>
So they filled them to the brim.
</p>

<p>
<a id="2-8"></a> <b>8</b> “Now draw some out,” He said, “and take it to the master of the banquet.”
</p>

<p>
They did so, 
<a id="2-9"></a> <b>9</b> and the master of the banquet tasted the water that had been turned into wine. He did not know where it was from, but the servants who had drawn the water knew. Then he called the bridegroom aside 
<a id="2-10"></a> <b>10</b> and said, “Everyone serves the fine wine first, and then the cheap wine after the guests are drunk. But you have saved the fine wine until now!”
</p>

<p>
<a id="2-11"></a> <b>11</b> Jesus performed this, the first of His signs, at Cana in Galilee. He thus revealed His glory, and His disciples believed in Him.

<p>
<a id="2-12"></a> <b>12</b> After this, He went down to Capernaum with His mother and brothers and His disciples, and they stayed there a few days.
</p>

<p>
<a id="2-13"></a> <b>13</b> When the Jewish Passover was near, Jesus went up to Jerusalem. 
<a id="2-14"></a> <b>14</b> In the temple courts He found men selling cattle, sheep, and doves, and money changers seated at their tables. 
<a id="2-15"></a> <b>15</b> So He made a whip out of cords and drove all from the temple courts, both sheep and cattle. He poured out the coins of the money changers and overturned their tables. 
<a id="2-16"></a> <b>16</b> To those selling doves He said, “Get these out of here! How dare you turn My Father&rsquo;s house into a marketplace!”
</p>

<p>
<a id="2-17"></a> <b>17</b> His disciples remembered that it is written: “Zeal for Your house will consume Me.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="2-18"></a> <b>18</b> On account of this, the Jews demanded, “What sign can You show us to prove Your authority to do these things?”
</p>

<p>
<a id="2-19"></a> <b>19</b> Jesus answered, “Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up again.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="2-20"></a> <b>20</b> “This temple took forty-six years to build,” the Jews replied, “and You are going to raise it up in three days?”
</p>

<p>
<a id="2-21"></a> <b>21</b> But Jesus was speaking about the temple of His body. 
<a id="2-22"></a> <b>22</b> After He was raised from the dead, His disciples remembered that He had said this. Then they believed the Scripture and the word that Jesus had spoken.
</p>

<p>
<a id="2-23"></a> <b>23</b> While He was in Jerusalem at the Passover Feast, many people saw the signs He was doing and believed in His name. 
<a id="2-24"></a> <b>24</b> But Jesus did not entrust Himself to them, for He knew them all. 
<a id="2-25"></a> <b>25</b> He did not need any testimony about man, for He knew what was in a man.

</p>

<p>
<a id="3-1"></a> Now there was a man of the Pharisees named Nicodemus, a leader of the Jews. 
<a id="3-2"></a> <b>2</b> He came to Jesus at night and said, “Rabbi, we know that You are a teacher who has come from God. For no one could perform the signs You are doing if God were not with him.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="3-3"></a> <b>3</b> Jesus replied, “Truly, truly, I tell you, no one can see the kingdom of God unless he is born again.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="3-4"></a> <b>4</b> “How can a man be born when he is old?” Nicodemus asked. “Can he enter his mother&rsquo;s womb a second time to be born?”
</p>

<p>
<a id="3-5"></a> <b>5</b> Jesus answered, “Truly, truly, I tell you, no one can enter the kingdom of God unless he is born of water and the Spirit. 
<a id="3-6"></a> <b>6</b> Flesh is born of flesh, but spirit is born of the Spirit. 
<a id="3-7"></a> <b>7</b> Do not be amazed that I said, ‘You must be born again.&rsquo; 
<a id="3-8"></a> <b>8</b> The wind blows where it wishes. You hear its sound, but you do not know where it comes from or where it is going. So it is with everyone born of the Spirit.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="3-9"></a> <b>9</b> “How can this be?” Nicodemus asked.
</p>

<p>
<a id="3-10"></a> <b>10</b> “You are Israel&rsquo;s teacher,” said Jesus, “and you do not understand these things? 
<a id="3-11"></a> <b>11</b> Truly, truly, I tell you, we speak of what we know, and we testify to what we have seen, and yet you people do not accept our testimony.
</p>

<p>
<a id="3-12"></a> <b>12</b> If I have told you about earthly things and you do not believe, how will you believe if I tell you about heavenly things? 
<a id="3-13"></a> <b>13</b> No one has ascended into heaven except the One who descended from heaven&#x2014;the Son of Man. 
<a id="3-14"></a> <b>14</b> Just as Moses lifted up the snake in the wilderness, so the Son of Man must be lifted up, 
<a id="3-15"></a> <b>15</b> that everyone who believes in Him may have eternal life.
</p>

<p>
<a id="3-16"></a> <b>16</b> For God so loved the world that He gave His one and only Son, that everyone who believes in Him shall not perish but have eternal life. 
<a id="3-17"></a> <b>17</b> For God did not send His Son into the world to condemn the world, but to save the world through Him. 
<a id="3-18"></a> <b>18</b> Whoever believes in Him is not condemned, but whoever does not believe has already been condemned, because he has not believed in the name of God&rsquo;s one and only Son.
</p>

<p>
<a id="3-19"></a> <b>19</b> And this is the verdict: The Light has come into the world, but men loved the darkness rather than the Light because their deeds were evil. 
<a id="3-20"></a> <b>20</b> Everyone who does evil hates the Light, and does not come into the Light for fear that his deeds will be exposed. 
<a id="3-21"></a> <b>21</b> But whoever practices the truth comes into the Light, so that it may be seen clearly that what he has done has been accomplished in God.”

<a id="3-22"></a> <b>22</b> After this, Jesus and His disciples went into the Judean countryside, where He spent some time with them and baptized.
</p>

<p>
<a id="3-23"></a> <b>23</b> Now John was also baptizing at Aenon near Salim, because the water was plentiful there, and people kept coming to be baptized. 24(For John had not yet been thrown into prison.)
</p>

<p>
<a id="3-25"></a> <b>25</b> Then a dispute arose between John&rsquo;s disciples and a certain Jew over the issue of ceremonial washing. 
<a id="3-26"></a> <b>26</b> So John&rsquo;s disciples came to him and said, “Look, Rabbi, the One who was with you beyond the Jordan, the One you testified about&#x2014;He is baptizing, and everyone is going to Him.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="3-27"></a> <b>27</b> John replied, “A man can receive only what is given him from heaven. 
<a id="3-28"></a> <b>28</b> You yourselves can testify that I said, ‘I am not the Christ, but am sent ahead of Him.&rsquo; 
<a id="3-29"></a> <b>29</b> The bride belongs to the bridegroom. The friend of the bridegroom stands and listens for him, and is overjoyed to hear the bridegroom&rsquo;s voice. That joy is mine, and it is now complete. 
<a id="3-30"></a> <b>30</b> He must increase; I must decrease.
</p>

<p>
<a id="3-31"></a> <b>31</b> The One who comes from above is above all. The one who is from the earth belongs to the earth and speaks as one from the earth. The One who comes from heaven is above all. 
<a id="3-32"></a> <b>32</b> He testifies to what He has seen and heard, yet no one accepts His testimony. 
<a id="3-33"></a> <b>33</b> Whoever accepts His testimony has certified that God is truthful. 
<a id="3-34"></a> <b>34</b> For the One whom God has sent speaks the words of God, for God gives the Spirit without limit.

<p>
<a id="4-1"></a> When Jesus realized that the Pharisees were aware He was gaining and baptizing more disciples than John 2(although it was not Jesus who baptized, but His disciples), 
<a id="4-3"></a> <b>3</b> He left Judea and returned to Galilee.
</p>

<p>
<a id="4-4"></a> <b>4</b> Now He had to pass through Samaria. 
<a id="4-5"></a> <b>5</b> So He came to a town of Samaria called Sychar, near the plot of ground that Jacob had given to his son Joseph. 
<a id="4-6"></a> <b>6</b> Since Jacob&rsquo;s well was there, Jesus, weary from His journey, sat down by the well. It was about the sixth hour.
</p>

<p>
<a id="4-7"></a> <b>7</b> When a Samaritan woman came to draw water, Jesus said to her, “Give Me a drink.” 8(His disciples had gone into the town to buy food.)
</p>

<p>
<a id="4-9"></a> <b>9</b> “You are a Jew,” said the woman. “How can You ask for a drink from me, a Samaritan woman?” (For Jews do not associate with Samaritans.)
</p>

<p>
<a id="4-10"></a> <b>10</b> Jesus answered, “If you knew the gift of God and who is asking you for a drink, you would have asked Him, and He would have given you living water.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="4-11"></a> <b>11</b> “Sir,” the woman replied, “You have nothing to draw with and the well is deep. Where then will You get this living water? 
<a id="4-12"></a> <b>12</b> Are You greater than our father Jacob, who gave us this well and drank from it himself, as did his sons and his livestock?”
</p>

<p>
<a id="4-13"></a> <b>13</b> Jesus said to her, “Everyone who drinks this water will be thirsty again. 
<a id="4-14"></a> <b>14</b> But whoever drinks the water I give him will never thirst. Indeed, the water I give him will become in him a fount of water springing up to eternal life.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="4-15"></a> <b>15</b> The woman said to Him, “Sir, give me this water so that I will not get thirsty and have to keep coming here to draw water.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="4-16"></a> <b>16</b> Jesus told her, “Go, call your husband and come back.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="4-17"></a> <b>17</b> “I have no husband,” the woman replied.
</p>

<p>
Jesus said to her, “You are correct to say that you have no husband. 
<a id="4-18"></a> <b>18</b> In fact, you have had five husbands, and the man you now have is not your husband. You have spoken truthfully.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="4-19"></a> <b>19</b> “Sir,” the woman said, “I see that You are a prophet.

</p>

<a id="4-22"></a> <b>22</b> You worship what you do not know; we worship what we do know, for salvation is from the Jews. 
<a id="4-23"></a> <b>23</b> But a time is coming and has now come when the true worshipers will worship the Father in spirit and in truth, for the Father is seeking such as these to worship Him. 
<a id="4-24"></a> <b>24</b> God is Spirit, and His worshipers must worship Him in spirit and in truth.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="4-25"></a> <b>25</b> The woman said, “I know that Messiah” (called Christ) “is coming. When He comes, He will explain everything to us.”

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org5deb01a">
<p>
<a id="4-27"></a> <b>27</b> Just then His disciples returned and were surprised that He was speaking with a woman. But no one asked Him, “What do You want from her?” or “Why are You talking with her?”
</p>

<p>
<a id="4-28"></a> <b>28</b> Then the woman left her water jar, went back into the town, and said to the people,
<a id="4-29"></a> <b>29</b> “Come, see a man who told me everything I ever did. Could this be the Christ?” 
<a id="4-30"></a> <b>30</b> So they left the town and made their way toward Jesus.
</p>

<p>
<a id="4-31"></a> <b>31</b> Meanwhile the disciples urged Him, “Rabbi, eat something.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="4-32"></a> <b>32</b> But He told them, “I have food to eat that you know nothing about.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="4-33"></a> <b>33</b> So the disciples asked one another, “Could someone have brought Him food?”
</p>

<p>
<a id="4-34"></a> <b>34</b> Jesus explained, “My food is to do the will of Him who sent Me and to finish His work. 
<a id="4-35"></a> <b>35</b> Do you not say, ‘There are still four months until the harvest&rsquo;? I tell you, lift up your eyes and look at the fields, for they are ripe for harvest.
</p>

<p>
<a id="4-36"></a> <b>36</b> Already the reaper draws his wages and gathers a crop for eternal life, so that the sower and the reaper may rejoice together. 
<a id="4-37"></a> <b>37</b> For in this case the saying ‘One sows and another reaps&rsquo; is true.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgfab6166">
<p>
<a id="4-43"></a> <b>43</b> After two days, Jesus left for Galilee. 
<a id="4-44"></a> <b>44</b> Now He Himself had testified that a prophet has no honor in his own hometown. 
<a id="4-45"></a> <b>45</b> Yet when He arrived, the Galileans welcomed Him. They had seen all the great things He had done in Jerusalem at the feast, for they had gone there as well.
</p>

<p>
<a id="4-46"></a> <b>46</b> So once again He came to Cana in Galilee, where He had turned the water into wine. And there was a royal official whose son lay sick at Capernaum. 
<a id="4-47"></a> <b>47</b> When he heard that Jesus had come from Judea to Galilee, he went and begged Him to come down and heal his son, who was about to die.
</p>

<p>
<a id="4-48"></a> <b>48</b> Jesus said to him, “Unless you people see signs and wonders, you will never believe.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="4-49"></a> <b>49</b> “Sir,” the official said, “come down before my child dies.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="4-50"></a> <b>50</b> “Go,” said Jesus. “Your son will live.”
</p>

<p>
The man took Jesus at His word and departed. 
<a id="4-51"></a> <b>51</b> And while he was still on the way, his servants met him with the news that his boy was alive.
</p>

<p>
<a id="4-52"></a> <b>52</b> So he inquired as to the hour when his son had recovered, and they told him, “The fever left him yesterday at the seventh hour.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="4-53"></a> <b>53</b> Then the father realized that this was the very hour in which Jesus had told him, “Your son will live.” And he and all his household believed.

</p>

<p>
<a id="5-1"></a> Some time later there was a feast of the Jews, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.
</p>

<p>
<a id="5-2"></a> <b>2</b> Now there is in Jerusalem near the Sheep Gate a pool with five covered colonnades, which in Hebrew is called Bethesda. 
<a id="5-3"></a> <b>3</b> On these walkways lay a great number of the sick, the blind, the lame, and the paralyzed.
</p>

<p>
<a id="5-5"></a> <b>5</b> One man there had been an invalid for thirty-eight years. 
<a id="5-6"></a> <b>6</b> When Jesus saw him lying there and realized that he had spent a long time in this condition, He asked him, “Do you want to get well?”
</p>

<p>
<a id="5-7"></a> <b>7</b> “Sir,” the invalid replied, “I have no one to help me into the pool when the water is stirred. While I am on my way, someone else goes in before me.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="5-8"></a> <b>8</b> Then Jesus told him, “Get up, pick up your mat, and walk.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="5-9"></a> <b>9</b> Immediately the man was made well, and he picked up his mat and began to walk.
</p>

<p>
Now this happened on the Sabbath day, 
<a id="5-10"></a> <b>10</b> so the Jews said to the man who had been healed, “This is the Sabbath! It is unlawful for you to carry your mat.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="5-11"></a> <b>11</b> But he answered, “The man who made me well told me, ‘Pick up your mat and walk.&rsquo;”
</p>

<p>
<a id="5-12"></a> <b>12</b> “Who is this man who told you to pick it up and walk?” they asked.
</p>

<p>
<a id="5-13"></a> <b>13</b> But the man who was healed did not know who it was, for Jesus had slipped away while the crowd was there.
</p>

<p>
<a id="5-14"></a> <b>14</b> Afterward, Jesus found the man at the temple and said to him, “See, you have been made well. Stop sinning, or something worse may happen to you.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="5-15"></a> <b>15</b> And the man went away and told the Jews that it was Jesus who had made him well.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orga18fd03">
<p>
<a id="5-16"></a> <b>16</b> Now because Jesus was doing these things on the Sabbath, the Jews began to persecute Him. 
<a id="5-17"></a> <b>17</b> But Jesus answered them, “To this very day My Father is at His work, and I too am working.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="5-18"></a> <b>18</b> Because of this, the Jews tried all the harder to kill Him. Not only was He breaking the Sabbath, but He was even calling God His own Father, making Himself equal with God.
</p>

<p>
<a id="5-19"></a> <b>19</b> So Jesus replied, “Truly, truly, I tell you, the Son can do nothing by Himself, unless He sees the Father doing it. For whatever the Father does, the Son also does. 
<a id="5-20"></a> <b>20</b> The Father loves the Son and shows Him all He does. And to your amazement, He will show Him even greater works than these. 
<a id="5-21"></a> <b>21</b> For just as the Father raises the dead and gives them life, so also the Son gives life to whom He wishes.
</p>

<p>
<a id="5-22"></a> <b>22</b> Furthermore, the Father judges no one, but has assigned all judgment to the Son, 
<a id="5-23"></a> <b>23</b> so that all may honor the Son just as they honor the Father. Whoever does not honor the Son does not honor the Father who sent Him.
</p>

<p>
<a id="5-24"></a> <b>24</b> Truly, truly, I tell you, whoever hears My word and believes Him who sent Me has eternal life and will not come under judgment. Indeed, he has crossed over from death to life.
</p>

<p>
<a id="5-25"></a> <b>25</b> Truly, truly, I tell you, the hour is coming and has now come when the dead will hear the voice of the Son of God, and those who hear will live. 
<a id="5-26"></a> <b>26</b> For as the Father has life in Himself, so also He has granted the Son to have life in Himself. 
<a id="5-27"></a> <b>27</b> And He has given Him authority to execute judgment, because He is the Son of Man.
</p>

<p>
<a id="5-28"></a> <b>28</b> Do not be amazed at this, for the hour is coming when all who are in their graves will hear His voice 
<a id="5-29"></a> <b>29</b> and come out&#x2014;those who have done good to the resurrection of life, and those who have done evil to the resurrection of judgment.
</p>

<p>
<a id="5-30"></a> <b>30</b> I can do nothing by Myself; I judge only as I hear. And My judgment is just, because I do not seek My own will, but the will of Him who sent Me.

<a id="6-3"></a> <b>3</b> Then Jesus went up on the mountain and sat down with His disciples.
</p>

<p>
<a id="6-4"></a> <b>4</b> Now the Jewish Feast of the Passover was near. 
<a id="6-5"></a> <b>5</b> When Jesus looked up and saw a large crowd coming toward Him, He said to Philip, “Where can we buy bread for these people to eat?” 
<a id="6-6"></a> <b>6</b> But He was asking this to test him, for He knew what He was about to do.
</p>

<p>
<a id="6-7"></a> <b>7</b> Philip answered, “Two hundred denarii would not buy enough bread for each of them to have a small piece.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="6-8"></a> <b>8</b> One of His disciples, Andrew, Simon Peter&rsquo;s brother, said to Him,
<a id="6-9"></a> <b>9</b> “Here is a boy with five barley loaves and two small fish. But what difference will these make among so many?”
</p>

<p>
<a id="6-10"></a> <b>10</b> “Have the people sit down,” Jesus said. Now there was plenty of grass in that place, so the men sat down, about five thousand of them.
</p>

<p>
<a id="6-11"></a> <b>11</b> Then Jesus took the loaves and the fish, gave thanks, and distributed to those who were seated as much as they wanted.
</p>

<p>
<a id="6-12"></a> <b>12</b> And when everyone was full, He said to His disciples, “Gather the pieces that are left over, so that nothing will be wasted.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="6-13"></a> <b>13</b> So they collected them and filled twelve baskets with the pieces of the five barley loaves left over by those who had eaten.
</p>

<p>
<a id="6-14"></a> <b>14</b> When the people saw the sign that Jesus had performed, they began to say, “Truly this is the Prophet who is to come into the world.”

<a id="6-22"></a> <b>22</b> The next day, the crowd that had remained on the other side of the sea realized that only one boat had been there, and that Jesus had not boarded it with His disciples, but they had gone away alone. 
<a id="6-23"></a> <b>23</b> However, some boats from Tiberias landed near the place where the people had eaten the bread after the Lord had given thanks. 
<a id="6-24"></a> <b>24</b> So when the crowd saw that neither Jesus nor His disciples were there, they got into the boats and went to Capernaum to look for Him. 
<a id="6-25"></a> <b>25</b> When they found Him on the other side of the sea, they asked Him, “Rabbi, when did You get here?”
</p>

<p>
<a id="6-26"></a> <b>26</b> Jesus replied, “Truly, truly, I tell you, it is not because you saw these signs that you are looking for Me, but because you ate the loaves and had your fill.

<a id="6-31"></a> <b>31</b> Our fathers ate the manna in the wilderness, as it is written: ‘He gave them bread from heaven to eat.&rsquo;”

<a id="6-34"></a> <b>34</b> “Sir,” they said, “give us this bread at all times.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="6-35"></a> <b>35</b> Jesus answered, “I am the bread of life. Whoever comes to Me will never hunger, and whoever believes in Me will never thirst. 
<a id="6-36"></a> <b>36</b> But as I stated, you have seen Me and still you do not believe.
</p>

<p>
<a id="6-37"></a> <b>37</b> Everyone the Father gives Me will come to Me, and the one who comes to Me I will never drive away.

<p>
<a id="6-41"></a> <b>41</b> At this, the Jews began to grumble about Jesus because He had said, “I am the bread that came down from heaven.”

</p>

<p>
<a id="6-43"></a> <b>43</b> “Stop grumbling among yourselves,” Jesus replied.
<a id="6-44"></a> <b>44</b> “No one can come to Me unless the Father who sent Me draws him, and I will raise him up at the last day. 
<a id="6-45"></a> <b>45</b> It is written in the Prophets: ‘And they will all be taught by God.&rsquo; Everyone who has heard the Father and learned from Him comes to Me&#x2014; 
<a id="6-46"></a> <b>46</b> not that anyone has seen the Father except the One who is from God; only He has seen the Father.

<p>
<a id="6-47"></a> <b>47</b> Truly, truly, I tell you, he who believes has eternal life.

<p>
<a id="7-1"></a> After this, Jesus traveled throughout Galilee. He did not want to travel in Judea, because the Jews there were trying to kill Him. 
<a id="7-2"></a> <b>2</b> However, the Jewish Feast of Tabernacles was near. 
<a id="7-3"></a> <b>3</b> So Jesus&rsquo; brothers said to Him, “Leave here and go to Judea, so that Your disciples there may see the works You are doing. 
<a id="7-4"></a> <b>4</b> For no one who wants to be known publicly acts in secret. Since You are doing these things, show Yourself to the world.” 
<a id="7-5"></a> <b>5</b> For even His own brothers did not believe in Him.
</p>

<p>
<a id="7-6"></a> <b>6</b> Therefore Jesus told them, “Although your time is always at hand, My time has not yet come. 
<a id="7-7"></a> <b>7</b> The world cannot hate you, but it hates Me, because I testify that its works are evil. 
<a id="7-8"></a> <b>8</b> Go up to the feast on your own. I am not going up to this feast, because My time has not yet come.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="7-9"></a> <b>9</b> Having said this, Jesus remained in Galilee. 
<a id="7-10"></a> <b>10</b> But after His brothers had gone up to the feast, He also went&#x2014;not publicly, but in secret.
</p>

<p>
<a id="7-11"></a> <b>11</b> So the Jews were looking for Him at the feast and asking, “Where is He?”
</p>

<p>
<a id="7-12"></a> <b>12</b> Many in the crowds were whispering about Him. Some said, “He is a good man.”
</p>

<p>
But others replied, “No, He deceives the people.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="7-13"></a> <b>13</b> Yet no one would speak publicly about Him for fear of the Jews.
</p>

<p>
<a id="7-14"></a> <b>14</b> About halfway through the feast, Jesus went up to the temple courts and began to teach. 
<a id="7-15"></a> <b>15</b> The Jews were amazed and asked, “How did this man attain such learning without having studied?”
</p>

<p>
<a id="7-16"></a> <b>16</b> “My teaching is not My own,” Jesus replied. “It comes from Him who sent Me. 
<a id="7-17"></a> <b>17</b> If anyone desires to do His will, he will know whether My teaching is from God or whether I speak on My own. 
<a id="7-18"></a> <b>18</b> He who speaks on his own authority seeks his own glory, but He who seeks the glory of the One who sent Him is a man of truth; in Him there is no falsehood. 
<a id="7-19"></a> <b>19</b> Has not Moses given you the law? Yet not one of you keeps it. Why are you trying to kill Me?”
</p>

<p>
<a id="7-20"></a> <b>20</b> “You have a demon,” the crowd replied. “Who is trying to kill You?”
</p>

<p>
<a id="7-21"></a> <b>21</b> Jesus answered them, “I did one miracle, and you are all amazed. 
<a id="7-22"></a> <b>22</b> But because Moses gave you circumcision, you circumcise a boy on the Sabbath (not that it is from Moses, but from the patriarchs.) 
<a id="7-23"></a> <b>23</b> If a boy can be circumcised on the Sabbath so that the law of Moses will not be broken, why are you angry with Me for making the whole man well on the Sabbath?

<a id="7-26"></a> <b>26</b> Yet here He is, speaking publicly, and they are not saying anything to Him. Have the rulers truly recognized that this is the Christ? 
<a id="7-27"></a> <b>27</b> But we know where this man is from. When the Christ comes, no one will know where He is from.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="7-28"></a> <b>28</b> Then Jesus, still teaching in the temple courts, cried out, “You know Me, and you know where I am from. I have not come of My own accord, but He who sent Me is true. You do not know Him,

<a id="7-32"></a> <b>32</b> When the Pharisees heard the crowd whispering these things about Jesus, they and the chief priests sent officers to arrest Him. 
<a id="7-33"></a> <b>33</b> So Jesus said, “I am with you only a little while longer, and then I am going to the One who sent Me. 
<a id="7-34"></a> <b>34</b> You will look for Me, but you will not find Me; and where I am, you cannot come.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="7-35"></a> <b>35</b> At this, the Jews said to one another, “Where does He intend to go that we will not find Him? Will He go where the Jews are dispersed among the Greeks, and teach the Greeks?

<a id="8-3"></a> <b>3</b> The scribes and Pharisees, however, brought to Him a woman caught in adultery. They made her stand before them 
<a id="8-4"></a> <b>4</b> and said, “Teacher, this woman was caught in the act of adultery. 
<a id="8-5"></a> <b>5</b> In the Law Moses commanded us to stone such a woman. So what do You say?”
</p>

<p>
<a id="8-6"></a> <b>6</b> They said this to test Him, in order to have a basis for accusing Him. But Jesus bent down and began to write on the ground with His finger.
</p>

<p>
<a id="8-7"></a> <b>7</b> When they continued to question Him, He straightened up and said to them, “Let him who is without sin among you be the first to cast a stone at her.” 
<a id="8-8"></a> <b>8</b> And again He bent down and wrote on the ground.
</p>

<p>
<a id="8-9"></a> <b>9</b> When they heard this, they began to go away one by one, beginning with the older ones, until only Jesus was left, with the woman standing there.

</p>

<p>
<a id="8-14"></a> <b>14</b> Jesus replied, “Even if I testify about Myself, My testimony is valid, because I know where I came from and where I am going. But you do not know where I came from or where I am going. 
<a id="8-15"></a> <b>15</b> You judge according to the flesh; I judge no one.

<p>
<a id="8-25"></a> <b>25</b> “Who are You?” they asked.

<p>

<p>

<p>
And there was division among them. 
<a id="9-17"></a> <b>17</b> So once again they asked the man who had been blind, “What do you say about Him, since it was your eyes He opened?”
</p>

<p>
“He is a prophet,” the man replied.
</p>

<p>
<a id="9-18"></a> <b>18</b> The Jews still did not believe that the man had been blind and had received his sight until they summoned his parents 
<a id="9-19"></a> <b>19</b> and asked, “Is this your son, the one you say was born blind? So how is it that he can now see?”
</p>

<p>
<a id="9-20"></a> <b>20</b> His parents answered, “We know he is our son, and we know he was born blind. 
<a id="9-21"></a> <b>21</b> But how he can now see or who opened his eyes, we do not know. Ask him. He is old enough to speak for himself.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="9-22"></a> <b>22</b> His parents said this because they were afraid of the Jews. For the Jews had already determined that anyone who confessed Jesus as the Christ would be put out of the synagogue. 
<a id="9-23"></a> <b>23</b> That was why his parents said, “He is old enough. Ask him.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="9-24"></a> <b>24</b> So a second time they called for the man who had been blind and said, “Give glory to God! We know that this man is a sinner.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="9-25"></a> <b>25</b> He answered, “Whether He is a sinner I do not know. There is one thing I do know: I was blind, but now I see!”
</p>

<p>
<a id="9-26"></a> <b>26</b> “What did He do to you?” they asked. “How did He open your eyes?”
</p>

<p>
<a id="9-27"></a> <b>27</b> He replied, “I already told you, and you did not listen. Why do you want to hear it again? Do you also want to become His disciples?”
</p>

<p>
<a id="9-28"></a> <b>28</b> Then they heaped insults on him and said, “You are His disciple; we are disciples of Moses. 
<a id="9-29"></a> <b>29</b> We know that God spoke to Moses, but we do not know where this man is from.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="9-30"></a> <b>30</b> “That is remarkable indeed!” the man said. “You do not know where He is from, and yet He opened my eyes. 
<a id="9-31"></a> <b>31</b> We know that God does not listen to sinners, but He does listen to the one who worships Him and does His will. 
<a id="9-32"></a> <b>32</b> Never before has anyone heard of opening the eyes of a man born blind. 
<a id="9-33"></a> <b>33</b> If this man were not from God, He could do no such thing.”

<a id="10-3"></a> <b>3</b> The gatekeeper opens the gate for him, and the sheep listen for his voice. He calls his own sheep by name and leads them out.
</p>

<p>
<a id="10-4"></a> <b>4</b> When he has brought out all his own, he goes on ahead of them, and his sheep follow him because they know his voice. 
<a id="10-5"></a> <b>5</b> But they will never follow a stranger; in fact, they will flee from him because they do not recognize his voice.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="10-6"></a> <b>6</b> Jesus spoke to them using this illustration, but they did not understand what He was telling them. 
<a id="10-7"></a> <b>7</b> So He said to them again, “Truly, truly, I tell you, I am the gate for the sheep. 
<a id="10-8"></a> <b>8</b> All who came before Me were thieves and robbers, but the sheep did not listen to them.

<a id="10-10"></a> <b>10</b> The thief comes only to steal and kill and destroy. I have come that they may have life, and have it in all its fullness.
</p>

<p>
<a id="10-11"></a> <b>11</b> I am the good shepherd. The good shepherd lays down His life for the sheep. 
<a id="10-12"></a> <b>12</b> The hired hand is not the shepherd, and the sheep are not his own. When he sees the wolf coming, he abandons the sheep and runs away. Then the wolf pounces on them and scatters the flock. 
<a id="10-13"></a> <b>13</b> The man runs away because he is a hired servant and is unconcerned for the sheep.
</p>

<p>
<a id="10-14"></a> <b>14</b> I am the good shepherd. I know My sheep and My sheep know Me, 
<a id="10-15"></a> <b>15</b> just as the Father knows Me and I know the Father. And I lay down My life for the sheep. 
<a id="10-16"></a> <b>16</b> I have other sheep that are not of this fold. I must bring them in as well, and they will listen to My voice. Then there will be one flock and one shepherd.

<p>
<a id="10-19"></a> <b>19</b> Again there was division among the Jews because of Jesus&rsquo; message.

<a id="10-23"></a> <b>23</b> and Jesus was walking in the temple courts in Solomon&rsquo;s Colonnade. 
<a id="10-24"></a> <b>24</b> So the Jews gathered around Him and demanded, “How long will You keep us in suspense? If You are the Christ, tell us plainly.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="10-25"></a> <b>25</b> “I already told you,” Jesus replied, “but you did not believe. The works I do in My Father&rsquo;s name testify on My behalf. 
<a id="10-26"></a> <b>26</b> But because you are not My sheep, you refuse to believe. 
<a id="10-27"></a> <b>27</b> My sheep listen to My voice; I know them, and they follow Me.

<a id="10-30"></a> <b>30</b> I and the Father are one.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="10-31"></a> <b>31</b> At this, the Jews again picked up stones to stone Him. 
<a id="10-32"></a> <b>32</b> But Jesus responded, “I have shown you many good works from the Father. For which of these do you stone Me?”
</p>

<p>
<a id="10-33"></a> <b>33</b> “We are not stoning You for any good work,” said the Jews, “but for blasphemy, because You, who are a man, declare Yourself to be God.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="10-34"></a> <b>34</b> Jesus replied, “Is it not written in your Law: ‘I have said you are gods&rsquo;? 
<a id="10-35"></a> <b>35</b> If he called them gods to whom the word of God came&#x2014;and the Scripture cannot be broken&#x2014; 
<a id="10-36"></a> <b>36</b> then what about the One whom the Father sanctified and sent into the world? How then can you accuse Me of blasphemy for stating that I am the Son of God?
</p>

<p>
<a id="10-37"></a> <b>37</b> If I am not doing the works of My Father, then do not believe Me. 
<a id="10-38"></a> <b>38</b> But if I am doing them, even though you do not believe Me, believe the works themselves, so that you may know and understand that the Father is in Me, and I am in the Father.”

<p>
<a id="11-1"></a> At this time a man named Lazarus was sick. He lived in Bethany, the village of Mary and her sister Martha. 2(Mary, whose brother Lazarus was sick, was to anoint the Lord with perfume and wipe His feet with her hair.) 
<a id="11-3"></a> <b>3</b> So the sisters sent word to Jesus, “Lord, the one You love is sick.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="11-4"></a> <b>4</b> When Jesus heard this, He said, “This sickness will not end in death. No, it is for the glory of God, so that the Son of God may be glorified through it.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="11-5"></a> <b>5</b> Now Jesus loved Martha and her sister and Lazarus. 
<a id="11-6"></a> <b>6</b> So on hearing that Lazarus was sick, He stayed where He was for two days, 
<a id="11-7"></a> <b>7</b> and then He said to the disciples, “Let us go back to Judea.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="11-8"></a> <b>8</b> “Rabbi,” they replied, “the Jews just tried to stone You, and You are going back there?”
</p>

<p>
<a id="11-9"></a> <b>9</b> Jesus answered, “Are there not twelve hours of daylight? If anyone walks in the daytime, he will not stumble, because he sees by the light of this world. 
<a id="11-10"></a> <b>10</b> But if anyone walks at night, he will stumble, because he has no light.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="11-11"></a> <b>11</b> After He had said this, He told them, “Our friend Lazarus has fallen asleep, but I am going there to wake him up.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="11-12"></a> <b>12</b> His disciples replied, “Lord, if he is sleeping, he will get better.” 
<a id="11-13"></a> <b>13</b> They thought that Jesus was talking about actual sleep, but He was speaking about the death of Lazarus.
</p>

<p>
<a id="11-14"></a> <b>14</b> So Jesus told them plainly, “Lazarus is dead, 
<a id="11-15"></a> <b>15</b> and for your sake I am glad I was not there, so that you may believe. But let us go to him.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="11-16"></a> <b>16</b> Then Thomas called Didymus said to his fellow disciples, “Let us also go, so that we may die with Him.”

<a id="11-17"></a> <b>17</b> When Jesus arrived, He found that Lazarus had already spent four days in the tomb. 
<a id="11-18"></a> <b>18</b> Now Bethany was near Jerusalem, a little less than two miles away, 
<a id="11-19"></a> <b>19</b> and many of the Jews had come to Martha and Mary to console them in the loss of their brother. 
<a id="11-20"></a> <b>20</b> So when Martha heard that Jesus was coming, she went out to meet Him; but Mary stayed at home.
</p>

<p>
<a id="11-21"></a> <b>21</b> Martha said to Jesus, “Lord, if You had been here, my brother would not have died. 
<a id="11-22"></a> <b>22</b> But even now I know that God will give You whatever You ask of Him.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="11-23"></a> <b>23</b> “Your brother will rise again,” Jesus told her.
</p>

<p>
<a id="11-24"></a> <b>24</b> Martha replied, “I know that he will rise again in the resurrection at the last day.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="11-25"></a> <b>25</b> Jesus said to her, “I am the resurrection and the life. Whoever believes in Me will live, even though he dies. 
<a id="11-26"></a> <b>26</b> And everyone who lives and believes in Me will never die. Do you believe this?”
</p>

<p>
<a id="11-27"></a> <b>27</b> “Yes, Lord,” she answered, “I believe that You are the Christ, the Son of God, who was to come into the world.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="11-28"></a> <b>28</b> After Martha had said this, she went back and called her sister Mary aside to tell her, “The Teacher is here and is asking for you.” 
<a id="11-29"></a> <b>29</b> And when Mary heard this, she got up quickly and went to Him.
</p>

<p>
<a id="11-30"></a> <b>30</b> Now Jesus had not yet entered the village, but was still at the place where Martha had met Him. 
<a id="11-31"></a> <b>31</b> When the Jews who were in the house consoling Mary saw how quickly she got up and went out, they followed her, supposing she was going to the tomb to mourn there. 
<a id="11-32"></a> <b>32</b> When Mary came to Jesus and saw Him, she fell at His feet and said, “Lord, if You had been here, my brother would not have died.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="11-33"></a> <b>33</b> When Jesus saw her weeping, and the Jews who had come with her also weeping, He was deeply moved in spirit and troubled.
<a id="11-34"></a> <b>34</b> “Where have you put him?” He asked.

<p>
“Come and see, Lord,” they answered.

<a id="11-45"></a> <b>45</b> Therefore many of the Jews who had come to Mary, and had seen what Jesus did, believed in Him.

</p>

<p>
<a id="11-47"></a> <b>47</b> Then the chief priests and Pharisees convened the Sanhedrin and said, “What are we to do? This man is performing many signs. 
<a id="11-48"></a> <b>48</b> If we let Him go on like this, everyone will believe in Him, and then the Romans will come and take away both our place and our nation.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="11-49"></a> <b>49</b> But one of them, named Caiaphas, who was high priest that year, said to them, “You know nothing at all!

</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>
<a id="11-53"></a> <b>53</b> So from that day on they plotted to kill Him. 
<a id="11-54"></a> <b>54</b> As a result, Jesus no longer went about publicly among the Jews, but He withdrew to a town called Ephraim in an area near the wilderness. And He stayed there with the disciples.

<a id="12-12"></a> <b>12</b> The next day the great crowd that had come to the feast heard that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem. 
<a id="12-13"></a> <b>13</b> They took palm branches and went out to meet Him, shouting:
</p>

<p>
“Hosanna!”
</p>

<p>
“Blessed is He who comes in the name of the Lord!”
</p>

<p>
“Blessed is the King of Israel!”
</p>

<p>
<a id="12-14"></a> <b>14</b> Finding a young donkey, Jesus sat on it, as it is written:
</p>

<p>
<a id="12-15"></a> <b>15</b> “Do not be afraid, O Daughter of Zion.
</p>

<p>
See, your King is coming,
</p>

<p>
seated on the colt of a donkey.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="12-16"></a> <b>16</b> At first His disciples did not understand these things, but after Jesus was glorified they remembered what had been done to Him, and they realized that these very things had also been written about Him.
</p>

<p>
<a id="12-17"></a> <b>17</b> Meanwhile, many people continued to testify that they had been with Jesus when He called Lazarus from the tomb and raised him from the dead. 
<a id="12-18"></a> <b>18</b> That is also why the crowd went out to meet Him, because they heard that He had performed this sign.
</p>

<p>
<a id="12-19"></a> <b>19</b> Then the Pharisees said to one another, “You can see that this is doing you no good. Look how the whole world has gone after Him!”

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orga661e08">
<p>
<a id="12-20"></a> <b>20</b> Now there were some Greeks among those who went up to worship at the feast. 
<a id="12-21"></a> <b>21</b> They came to Philip, who was from Bethsaida in Galilee, and requested of him, “Sir, we want to see Jesus.” 
<a id="12-22"></a> <b>22</b> Philip relayed this appeal to Andrew, and both of them went and told Jesus.
</p>

<p>
<a id="12-23"></a> <b>23</b> But Jesus replied, “The hour has come for the Son of Man to be glorified. 
<a id="12-24"></a> <b>24</b> Truly, truly, I tell you, unless a kernel of wheat falls to the ground and dies, it remains only a seed; but if it dies, it bears much fruit. 
<a id="12-25"></a> <b>25</b> Whoever loves his life will lose it, but whoever hates his life in this world will keep it for eternal life. 
<a id="12-26"></a> <b>26</b> If anyone serves Me, he must follow Me; and where I am, My servant will be as well. If anyone serves Me, the Father will honor him.
</p>

<p>
<a id="12-27"></a> <b>27</b> Now My soul is troubled, and what shall I say? ‘Father, save Me from this hour&rsquo;? No, it is for this purpose that I have come to this hour. 
<a id="12-28"></a> <b>28</b> Father, glorify Your name!”
</p>

<p>
Then a voice came from heaven: “I have glorified it, and I will glorify it again.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="12-29"></a> <b>29</b> The crowd standing there heard it and said that it had thundered. Others said that an angel had spoken to Him.
</p>

<p>
<a id="12-30"></a> <b>30</b> In response, Jesus said, “This voice was not for My benefit, but yours. 
<a id="12-31"></a> <b>31</b> Now judgment is upon this world; now the prince of this world will be cast out. 
<a id="12-32"></a> <b>32</b> And I, when I am lifted up from the earth, will draw everyone to Myself.” 
<a id="12-33"></a> <b>33</b> He said this to indicate the kind of death He was going to die.
</p>

<p>
<a id="12-34"></a> <b>34</b> The crowd replied, “We have heard from the Law that the Christ will remain forever. So how can You say that the Son of Man must be lifted up? Who is this Son of Man?”
</p>

<p>
<a id="12-35"></a> <b>35</b> Then Jesus told them, “For a little while longer, the Light will be among you. Walk while you have the Light, so that darkness will not overtake you. The one who walks in the darkness does not know where he is going. 
<a id="12-36"></a> <b>36</b> While you have the Light, believe in the Light, so that you may become sons of light.”
</p>

<p>
After Jesus had spoken these things, He went away and was hidden from them.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgf1b6ed2">
<p>
<a id="12-37"></a> <b>37</b> Although Jesus had performed so many signs in their presence, they still did not believe in Him. 
<a id="12-38"></a> <b>38</b> This was to fulfill the word of Isaiah the prophet:
</p>

<p>
“Lord, who has believed our message?
</p>

<p>
And to whom has the arm of the Lord been revealed?”
</p>

<p>
<a id="12-39"></a> <b>39</b> For this reason they were unable to believe. For again, Isaiah says:
</p>

<p>
<a id="12-40"></a> <b>40</b> “He has blinded their eyes
</p>

<p>
and hardened their hearts,
</p>

<p>
so that they cannot see with their eyes,
</p>

<p>
and understand with their hearts,
</p>

<p>
and turn,
</p>

<p>
and I would heal them.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="12-41"></a> <b>41</b> Isaiah said these things because he saw Jesus&rsquo; glory and spoke about Him. 
<a id="12-42"></a> <b>42</b> Nevertheless, many of the leaders believed in Him; but because of the Pharisees they did not confess Him, for fear that they would be put out of the synagogue. 
<a id="12-43"></a> <b>43</b> For they loved praise from men more than praise from God.
</p>

<p>
<a id="12-44"></a> <b>44</b> Then Jesus cried out, “Whoever believes in Me does not believe in Me alone, but in the One who sent Me. 
<a id="12-45"></a> <b>45</b> And whoever sees Me sees the One who sent Me. 
<a id="12-46"></a> <b>46</b> I have come into the world as a light, so that no one who believes in Me should remain in darkness.
</p>

<p>
<a id="12-47"></a> <b>47</b> As for anyone who hears My words and does not keep them, I do not judge him. For I have not come to judge the world, but to save the world. 
<a id="12-48"></a> <b>48</b> There is a judge for the one who rejects Me and does not receive My words: The word that I have spoken will judge him on the last day.
</p>

<p>
<a id="12-49"></a> <b>49</b> I have not spoken on My own, but the Father who sent Me has commanded Me what to say and how to say it. 
<a id="12-50"></a> <b>50</b> And I know that His command leads to eternal life. So I speak exactly what the Father has told Me to say.”

<p>
<a id="13-1"></a> It was now just before the Passover Feast, and Jesus knew that His hour had come to leave this world and return to the Father. Having loved His own who were in the world, He loved them to the very end. 
<a id="13-2"></a> <b>2</b> The evening meal was underway, and the devil had already put into the heart of Judas, the son of Simon Iscariot, to betray Jesus.
</p>

<p>
<a id="13-3"></a> <b>3</b> Jesus knew that the Father had delivered all things into His hands, and that He had come from God and was returning to God. 
<a id="13-4"></a> <b>4</b> So He got up from the supper, laid aside His outer garments, and wrapped a towel around His waist. 
<a id="13-5"></a> <b>5</b> After that, He poured water into a basin and began to wash the disciples&rsquo; feet and dry them with the towel that was around Him.
</p>

<p>
<a id="13-6"></a> <b>6</b> He came to Simon Peter, who asked Him, “Lord, are You going to wash my feet?”
</p>

<p>
<a id="13-7"></a> <b>7</b> Jesus replied, “You do not realize now what I am doing, but later you will understand.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="13-8"></a> <b>8</b> “Never shall You wash my feet!” Peter told Him.
</p>

<p>
Jesus answered, “Unless I wash you, you have no part with Me.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="13-9"></a> <b>9</b> “Then, Lord,” Simon Peter replied, “not only my feet, but my hands and my head as well!”
</p>

<p>
<a id="13-10"></a> <b>10</b> Jesus told him, “Whoever has already bathed needs only to wash his feet, and he will be completely clean. And you are clean, though not all of you.” 
<a id="13-11"></a> <b>11</b> For He knew who would betray Him. That is why He said, “Not all of you are clean.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="13-12"></a> <b>12</b> When Jesus had washed their feet and put on His outer garments, He reclined with them again and asked, “Do you know what I have done for you? 
<a id="13-13"></a> <b>13</b> You call Me Teacher and Lord, and rightly so, because I am. 
<a id="13-14"></a> <b>14</b> So if I, your Lord and Teacher, have washed your feet, you also should wash one another&rsquo;s feet. 
<a id="13-15"></a> <b>15</b> I have set you an example so that you should do as I have done for you. 
<a id="13-16"></a> <b>16</b> Truly, truly, I tell you, no servant is greater than his master, nor is a messenger greater than the one who sent him. 
<a id="13-17"></a> <b>17</b> If you know these things, you will be blessed if you do them.

<p>
<a id="13-18"></a> <b>18</b> I am not speaking about all of you; I know whom I have chosen. But this is to fulfill the Scripture: ‘The one who shares My bread has lifted up his heel against Me.&rsquo; 
<a id="13-19"></a> <b>19</b> I am telling you now before it happens, so that when it comes to pass, you will believe that I am He.

</p>

<p>
<a id="13-21"></a> <b>21</b> After Jesus had said this, He became troubled in spirit and testified, “Truly, truly, I tell you, one of you will betray Me.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="13-22"></a> <b>22</b> The disciples looked at one another, perplexed as to which of them He meant. 
<a id="13-23"></a> <b>23</b> One of His disciples, the one whom Jesus loved, was reclining at His side. 
<a id="13-24"></a> <b>24</b> So Simon Peter motioned to him to ask Jesus which one He was talking about. 
<a id="13-25"></a> <b>25</b> Leaning back against Jesus, he asked, “Lord, who is it?”
</p>

<p>
<a id="13-26"></a> <b>26</b> Jesus answered, “It is the one to whom I give this morsel after I have dipped it.” Then He dipped the morsel and gave it to Judas son of Simon Iscariot. 
<a id="13-27"></a> <b>27</b> And when Judas had taken the morsel, Satan entered into him.
</p>

<p>
Then Jesus said to Judas, “What you are about to do, do quickly.” 
<a id="13-28"></a> <b>28</b> But no one at the table knew why Jesus had said this to him. 
<a id="13-29"></a> <b>29</b> Since Judas kept the money bag, some thought that Jesus was telling him to buy what was needed for the feast, or to give something to the poor. 
<a id="13-30"></a> <b>30</b> As soon as he had received the morsel, Judas went out into the night.

<p>
“Jesus of Nazareth,” they answered.

<p>
<a id="18-8"></a> <b>8</b> “I told you that I am He,” Jesus replied. “So if you are looking for Me, let these men go.”

<a id="19-12"></a> <b>12</b> From then on, Pilate tried to release Him, but the Jews kept shouting, “If you release this man, you are no friend of Caesar. Anyone who declares himself a king is defying Caesar.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="19-13"></a> <b>13</b> When Pilate heard these words, he brought Jesus out and sat on the judgment seat at a place called the Stone Pavement, which in Hebrew is Gabbatha. 
<a id="19-14"></a> <b>14</b> It was the day of Preparation for the Passover, about the sixth hour. And Pilate said to the Jews, “Here is your King!”
</p>

<p>
<a id="19-15"></a> <b>15</b> At this, they shouted, “Away with Him! Away with Him! Crucify Him!”
</p>

<p>
“Shall I crucify your King?” Pilate asked.
</p>

<p>
“We have no king but Caesar,” replied the chief priests.

<p>
<a id="19-16"></a> <b>16</b> Then Pilate handed Jesus over to be crucified, and the soldiers took Him away. 
<a id="19-17"></a> <b>17</b> Carrying His own cross, He went out to The Place of the Skull, which in Hebrew is called Golgotha.
</p>

<p>
<a id="19-18"></a> <b>18</b> There they crucified Him, and with Him two others, one on each side, with Jesus in the middle.
</p>

<p>
<a id="19-19"></a> <b>19</b> Pilate also had a notice posted on the cross. It read:
</p>

<p>
JESUS OF NAZARETH, THE KING OF THE JEWS.
</p>

<p>
<a id="19-20"></a> <b>20</b> Many of the Jews read this sign, because the place where Jesus was crucified was near the city, and it was written in Hebrew, Latin, and Greek. 
<a id="19-21"></a> <b>21</b> So the chief priests of the Jews said to Pilate, “Do not write, ‘The King of the Jews,&rsquo; but only that He said, ‘I am the King of the Jews.&rsquo;”
</p>

<p>
<a id="19-22"></a> <b>22</b> Pilate answered, “What I have written, I have written.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="19-23"></a> <b>23</b> When the soldiers had crucified Jesus, they divided His garments into four parts, one for each soldier, with the tunic remaining. It was seamless, woven in one piece from top to bottom. 
<a id="19-24"></a> <b>24</b> So they said to one another, “Let us not tear it. Instead, let us cast lots to see who will get it.” This was to fulfill the Scripture:
</p>

<p>
“They divided My garments among them,
</p>

<p>
and cast lots for My clothing.”
</p>

<p>
So that is what the soldiers did.

<a id="19-25"></a> <b>25</b> Near the cross of Jesus stood His mother and her sister, as well as Mary the wife of Clopas and Mary Magdalene. 
<a id="19-26"></a> <b>26</b> When Jesus saw His mother and the disciple whom He loved standing nearby, He said to His mother, “Woman, here is your son.” 
<a id="19-27"></a> <b>27</b> Then He said to the disciple, “Here is your mother.” So from that hour, this disciple took her into his home.

<p>
<a id="19-28"></a> <b>28</b> After this, knowing that everything had now been accomplished, and to fulfill the Scripture, Jesus said, “I am thirsty.” 
<a id="19-29"></a> <b>29</b> A jar of sour wine was sitting there. So they soaked a sponge in the wine, put it on a stalk of hyssop, and lifted it to His mouth.

<a id="19-31"></a> <b>31</b> It was the day of Preparation, and the next day was a High Sabbath. In order that the bodies would not remain on the cross during the Sabbath, the Jews asked Pilate to have the legs broken and the bodies removed. 
<a id="19-32"></a> <b>32</b> So the soldiers came and broke the legs of the first man who had been crucified with Jesus, and those of the other.
</p>

<p>
<a id="19-33"></a> <b>33</b> But when they came to Jesus and saw that He was already dead, they did not break His legs. 
<a id="19-34"></a> <b>34</b> Instead, one of the soldiers pierced His side with a spear, and immediately blood and water flowed out.

</p>

<p>
<a id="20-13"></a> <b>13</b> “Woman, why are you weeping?” they asked.

<p>
“Because they have taken my Lord away,” she said, “and I do not know where they have put Him.”

<a id="21-1"></a> Later, by the Sea of Tiberias, Jesus again revealed Himself to the disciples. He made Himself known in this way: 
<a id="21-2"></a> <b>2</b> Simon Peter, Thomas called Didymus, Nathanael from Cana in Galilee, the sons of Zebedee, and two other disciples were together. 
<a id="21-3"></a> <b>3</b> Simon Peter told them, “I am going fishing.”
</p>

<p>
“We will go with you,” they said. So they went out and got into the boat, but caught nothing that night.
</p>

<p>
<a id="21-4"></a> <b>4</b> Early in the morning, Jesus stood on the shore, but the disciples did not recognize that it was Jesus. 
<a id="21-5"></a> <b>5</b> So He called out to them, “Children, do you have any fish?”
</p>

<p>
“No,” they answered.
</p>

<p>
<a id="21-6"></a> <b>6</b> He told them, “Cast the net on the right side of the boat, and you will find some.” So they cast it there, and they were unable to haul it in because of the great number of fish.
</p>

<p>
<a id="21-7"></a> <b>7</b> Then the disciple whom Jesus loved said to Peter, “It is the Lord!” As soon as Simon Peter heard that it was the Lord, he put on his outer garment (for he had removed it) and jumped into the sea. 
<a id="21-8"></a> <b>8</b> The other disciples came ashore in the boat. They dragged in the net full of fish, for they were not far from land, only about a hundred yards.
</p>

<p>
<a id="21-9"></a> <b>9</b> When they landed, they saw a charcoal fire there with fish on it, and some bread.
</p>

<p>
<a id="21-10"></a> <b>10</b> Jesus told them, “Bring some of the fish you have just caught.” 
<a id="21-11"></a> <b>11</b> So Simon Peter went aboard and dragged the net ashore. It was full of large fish, 153, but even with so many, the net was not torn.
</p>

<p>
<a id="21-12"></a> <b>12</b> “Come, have breakfast,” Jesus said to them. None of the disciples dared to ask Him, “Who are You?” They knew it was the Lord. 
<a id="21-13"></a> <b>13</b> Jesus came and took the bread and gave it to them, and He did the same with the fish.

</p>

<p>
“Yes, Lord,” he answered, “You know I love You.”
</p>

<p>
Jesus replied, “Feed My lambs.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="21-16"></a> <b>16</b> Jesus asked a second time, “Simon son of John, do you love Me?”
</p>

<p>
“Yes, Lord,” he answered, “You know I love You.”

<p>
Jesus told him, “Shepherd My sheep.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="21-17"></a> <b>17</b> Jesus asked a third time, “Simon son of John, do you love Me?”

<p>
Peter was deeply hurt that Jesus had asked him a third time, “Do you love Me?”

<p>
“Lord, You know all things,” he replied. “You know I love You.”

Jesus said to him, “Feed My sheep.

<a id="21-21"></a> <b>21</b> When Peter saw him, he asked, “Lord, what about him?”
</p>

<p>
<a id="21-22"></a> <b>22</b> Jesus answered, “If I want him to remain until I return, what is that to you? You follow Me!” 
<a id="21-23"></a> <b>23</b> Because of this, the rumor spread among the brothers that this disciple would not die. However, Jesus did not say that he would not die, but only, “If I want him to remain until I return, what is that to you?”

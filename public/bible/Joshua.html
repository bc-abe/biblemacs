<a id="1-2"></a> <b>2</b> “Moses My servant is dead. Now therefore arise, you and all these people, and cross over the Jordan into the land that I am giving to the children of Israel.
</p>

<p>
<a id="1-3"></a> <b>3</b> I have given you every place where the sole of your foot will tread, just as I promised to Moses. 
<a id="1-4"></a> <b>4</b> Your territory shall extend from the wilderness and Lebanon to the great River Euphrates&#x2014;all the land of the Hittites&#x2014;and west as far as the Great Sea.
</p>

<p>
<a id="1-5"></a> <b>5</b> No one shall stand against you all the days of your life. As I was with Moses, so will I be with you; I will never leave you nor forsake you.
</p>

<p>
<a id="1-6"></a> <b>6</b> Be strong and courageous, for you shall give these people the inheritance of the land that I swore to their fathers I would give them.
</p>

<p>
<a id="1-7"></a> <b>7</b> Above all, be strong and very courageous. Be careful to observe all the law that My servant Moses commanded you. Do not turn from it to the right or to the left, so that you may prosper wherever you go. 
<a id="1-8"></a> <b>8</b> This Book of the Law must not depart from your mouth; meditate on it day and night, so that you may be careful to do everything written in it. For then you will prosper and succeed in all you do.
</p>

<p>
<a id="1-9"></a> <b>9</b> Have I not commanded you to be strong and courageous? Do not be afraid; do not be discouraged, for the LORD your God is with you wherever you go.”

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org379a027">
<p>
<a id="1-10"></a> <b>10</b> Then Joshua commanded the officers of the people:
<a id="1-11"></a> <b>11</b> “Go through the camp and tell the people, ‘Prepare your provisions, for within three days you will cross the Jordan to go in and take possession of the land that the LORD your God is giving you to possess.&rsquo; ”
</p>

<p>
<a id="1-12"></a> <b>12</b> But to the Reubenites, the Gadites, and the half-tribe of Manasseh, Joshua said,
<a id="1-13"></a> <b>13</b> “Remember what Moses the servant of the LORD commanded you when he said, ‘The LORD your God will give you rest, and He will give you this land.&rsquo; 
<a id="1-14"></a> <b>14</b> Your wives, your young children, and your livestock may remain in the land that Moses gave you on this side of the Jordan. But all your mighty men of valor must be armed for battle to cross over ahead of your brothers and help them, 
<a id="1-15"></a> <b>15</b> until the LORD gives them rest as He has done for you, and your brothers also possess the land that the LORD your God is giving them. Then you may return to the land of your inheritance and take possession of that which Moses the servant of the LORD gave you on the east side of the Jordan.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="1-16"></a> <b>16</b> So they answered Joshua, “Everything you have commanded us we will do, and everywhere you send us we will go. 
<a id="1-17"></a> <b>17</b> Just as we obeyed Moses in all things, so we will obey you. And may the LORD your God be with you, as He was with Moses. 
<a id="1-18"></a> <b>18</b> Anyone who rebels against your order and does not obey your words, all that you command him, will be put to death. Above all, be strong and courageous!”

</p>

<p>
<a id="2-1"></a> Then Joshua son of Nun secretly sent two spies from Shittim, saying, “Go, inspect the land, especially Jericho.” So they went and entered the house of a prostitute named Rahab and stayed there.
</p>

<p>
<a id="2-2"></a> <b>2</b> And it was reported to the king of Jericho: “Behold, some men of Israel have come here tonight to spy out the land.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="2-3"></a> <b>3</b> So the king of Jericho sent to Rahab and said, “Bring out the men who came to you and entered your house, for they have come to spy out the whole land.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="2-4"></a> <b>4</b> But the woman had taken the two men and hidden them. So she said, “Yes, the men did come to me, but I did not know where they had come from. 
<a id="2-5"></a> <b>5</b> At dusk, when the gate was about to close, the men went out, and I do not know which way they went. Pursue them quickly, and you may catch them!” 6(But Rahab had taken them up to the roof and hidden them among the stalks of flax that she had laid out there.)
</p>

<p>
<a id="2-7"></a> <b>7</b> So the king&rsquo;s men set out in pursuit of the spies along the road to the fords of the Jordan, and as soon as they had gone out, the gate was shut.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgc2f8859" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orgc2f8859">The Promise to Rahab</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgc2f8859">
<p>
<a id="2-8"></a> <b>8</b> Before the spies lay down for the night, Rahab went up on the roof 
<a id="2-9"></a> <b>9</b> and said to them, “I know that the LORD has given you this land and that the fear of you has fallen on us, so that all who dwell in the land are melting in fear of you. 
<a id="2-10"></a> <b>10</b> For we have heard how the LORD dried up the waters of the Red Sea before you when you came out of Egypt, and what you did to Sihon and Og, the two kings of the Amorites across the Jordan, whom you devoted to destruction. 
<a id="2-11"></a> <b>11</b> When we heard this, our hearts melted and everyone&rsquo;s courage failed because of you, for the LORD your God is God in the heavens above and on the earth below.
</p>

<p>
<a id="2-12"></a> <b>12</b> Now therefore, please swear to me by the LORD that you will indeed show kindness to my family, because I showed kindness to you. Give me a sure sign 
<a id="2-13"></a> <b>13</b> that you will spare the lives of my father and mother, my brothers and sisters, and all who belong to them, and that you will deliver us from death.”
<a id="2-14"></a> <b>14</b> “Our lives for your lives!” the men agreed. “If you do not report our mission, we will show you kindness and faithfulness when the LORD gives us the land.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="2-15"></a> <b>15</b> Then Rahab let them down by a rope through the window, since the house where she lived was built into the wall of the city.
<a id="2-16"></a> <b>16</b> “Go to the hill country,” she said, “so that your pursuers will not find you. Hide yourselves there for three days until they have returned; then go on your way.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="2-17"></a> <b>17</b> The men said to her, “We will not be bound by this oath you made us swear 
<a id="2-18"></a> <b>18</b> unless, when we enter the land, you have tied this scarlet cord in the window through which you let us down, and unless you have brought your father and mother and brothers and all your family into your house. 
<a id="2-19"></a> <b>19</b> If anyone goes out the door of your house into the street, his blood will be on his own head, and we will be innocent. But if a hand is laid on anyone with you in the house, his blood will be on our heads. 
<a id="2-20"></a> <b>20</b> And if you report our mission, we will be released from the oath you made us swear.”
<a id="2-21"></a> <b>21</b> “Let it be as you say,” she replied, and she sent them away. And when they had gone, she tied the scarlet cord in the window.
</p>

<p>
<a id="2-22"></a> <b>22</b> So the spies went out into the hill country and stayed there three days, until their pursuers had returned without finding them, having searched all along the road. 
<a id="2-23"></a> <b>23</b> Then the two men started back, came down from the hill country, and crossed the river. So they came to Joshua son of Nun and reported all that had happened to them.
<a id="2-24"></a> <b>24</b> “The LORD has surely delivered the entire land into our hands,” they said to Joshua. “Indeed, all who dwell in the land are melting in fear of us.”

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org1fb5fa6">
<p>
<span class="drop">3</span>
</p>

<p>
<a id="3-1"></a> Early the next morning Joshua got up and left Shittim with all the Israelites. They went as far as the Jordan, where they camped before crossing over.
</p>

<p>
<a id="3-2"></a> <b>2</b> After three days the officers went through the camp 
<a id="3-3"></a> <b>3</b> and commanded the people: “When you see the ark of the covenant of the LORD your God being carried by the Levitical priests, you are to set out from your positions and follow it. 
<a id="3-4"></a> <b>4</b> But keep a distance of about two thousand cubits between yourselves and the ark. Do not go near it, so that you can see the way to go, since you have never traveled this way before.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="3-5"></a> <b>5</b> Then Joshua told the people, “Consecrate yourselves, for tomorrow the LORD will do wonders among you.” 
<a id="3-6"></a> <b>6</b> And he said to the priests, “Take the ark of the covenant and go on ahead of the people.” So they carried the ark of the covenant and went ahead of them.
</p>

<p>
<a id="3-7"></a> <b>7</b> Now the LORD said to Joshua, “Today I will begin to exalt you in the sight of all Israel, so they may know that I am with you just as I was with Moses. 
<a id="3-8"></a> <b>8</b> Command the priests carrying the ark of the covenant: ‘When you reach the edge of the waters, stand in the Jordan.&rsquo; ”
</p>

<p>
<a id="3-9"></a> <b>9</b> So Joshua told the Israelites, “Come here and listen to the words of the LORD your God.” 
<a id="3-10"></a> <b>10</b> He continued, “This is how you will know that the living God is among you and that He will surely drive out before you the Canaanites, Hittites, Hivites, Perizzites, Girgashites, Amorites, and Jebusites. 
<a id="3-11"></a> <b>11</b> Behold, the ark of the covenant of the Lord of all the earth will go ahead of you into the Jordan.
</p>

<p>
<a id="3-12"></a> <b>12</b> Now choose twelve men from the tribes of Israel, one from each tribe. 
<a id="3-13"></a> <b>13</b> When the feet of the priests who carry the ark of the LORD&#x2014;the Lord of all the earth&#x2014;touch down in the waters of the Jordan, its flowing waters will be cut off and will stand up in a heap.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="3-14"></a> <b>14</b> So when the people broke camp to cross the Jordan, the priests carried the ark of the covenant ahead of them.
</p>

<p>
<a id="3-15"></a> <b>15</b> Now the Jordan overflows its banks throughout the harvest season. But as soon as the priests carrying the ark reached the Jordan and their feet touched the water&rsquo;s edge, 
<a id="3-16"></a> <b>16</b> the flowing water stood still. It backed up as far upstream as Adam, a city in the area of Zarethan, while the water flowing toward the Sea of the Arabah (the Salt Sea) was completely cut off. So the people crossed over opposite Jericho. 
<a id="3-17"></a> <b>17</b> The priests carrying the ark of the covenant of the LORD stood firm on dry ground in the middle of the Jordan, while all Israel crossed over the dry ground, until the entire nation had crossed the Jordan.

<h3 id="org4cea409">Twelve Stones from the Jordan</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org4cea409">
<p>

</p>

<p>
<a id="4-1"></a> When the whole nation had finished crossing the Jordan, the LORD said to Joshua,
<a id="4-2"></a> <b>2</b> “Choose twelve men from among the people, one from each tribe, 
<a id="4-3"></a> <b>3</b> and command them: ‘Take up for yourselves twelve stones from the middle of the Jordan where the priests were standing, carry them with you, and set them down in the place where you spend the night.&rsquo; ”
</p>

<p>
<a id="4-4"></a> <b>4</b> So Joshua summoned the twelve men he had appointed from the Israelites, one from each tribe, 
<a id="4-5"></a> <b>5</b> and said to them, “Cross over before the ark of the LORD your God into the middle of the Jordan. Each of you is to take a stone upon his shoulder, according to the number of the tribes of Israel, 
<a id="4-6"></a> <b>6</b> to serve as a sign among you. In the future, when your children ask, ‘What do these stones mean to you?&rsquo; 
<a id="4-7"></a> <b>7</b> you are to tell them, ‘The waters of the Jordan were cut off before the ark of the covenant of the LORD. When it crossed the Jordan, the waters were cut off.&rsquo; Therefore these stones will be a memorial to the Israelites forever.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="4-8"></a> <b>8</b> Thus the Israelites did as Joshua had commanded them. They took up twelve stones from the middle of the Jordan, one for each tribe of Israel, just as the LORD had told Joshua; and they carried them to the camp, where they set them down.
</p>

<p>
<a id="4-9"></a> <b>9</b> Joshua also set up twelve stones in the middle of the Jordan, in the place where the priests who carried the ark of the covenant stood. And the stones are there to this day.
</p>

<p>
<a id="4-10"></a> <b>10</b> Now the priests who carried the ark remained standing in the middle of the Jordan until the people had completed everything the LORD had commanded Joshua to tell them, just as Moses had directed Joshua. The people hurried across, 
<a id="4-11"></a> <b>11</b> and after everyone had finished crossing, the priests with the ark of the LORD crossed in the sight of the people. 
<a id="4-12"></a> <b>12</b> The Reubenites, the Gadites, and the half-tribe of Manasseh crossed over before the Israelites, armed for battle as Moses had instructed them. 
<a id="4-13"></a> <b>13</b> About 40,000 troops armed for battle crossed over before the LORD into the plains of Jericho.
</p>

<p>
<a id="4-14"></a> <b>14</b> On that day the LORD exalted Joshua in the sight of all Israel, and they revered him all the days of his life, just as they had revered Moses.
</p>

<p>
<a id="4-15"></a> <b>15</b> Then the LORD said to Joshua,
<a id="4-16"></a> <b>16</b> “Command the priests who carry the ark of the Testimony to come up from the Jordan.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="4-17"></a> <b>17</b> So Joshua commanded the priests, “Come up from the Jordan.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="4-18"></a> <b>18</b> When the priests carrying the ark of the covenant of the LORD came up out of the Jordan and their feet touched the dry land, the waters of the Jordan returned to their course and overflowed all the banks as before.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org5688a1a">
<p>
<a id="4-19"></a> <b>19</b> On the tenth day of the first month the people went up from the Jordan and camped at Gilgal on the eastern border of Jericho. 
<a id="4-20"></a> <b>20</b> And there at Gilgal Joshua set up the twelve stones they had taken from the Jordan.
</p>

<p>
<a id="4-21"></a> <b>21</b> Then Joshua said to the Israelites, “In the future, when your children ask their fathers, ‘What is the meaning of these stones?&rsquo; 
<a id="4-22"></a> <b>22</b> you are to tell them, ‘Israel crossed the Jordan on dry ground.&rsquo; 
<a id="4-23"></a> <b>23</b> For the LORD your God dried up the waters of the Jordan before you until you had crossed over, just as He did to the Red Sea, which He dried up before us until we had crossed over. 
<a id="4-24"></a> <b>24</b> He did this so that all the peoples of the earth may know that the hand of the LORD is mighty, and so that you may always fear the LORD your God.”

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgab65334">
<p>
<span class="drop">5</span>
</p>

<p>
<a id="5-1"></a> Now when all the Amorite kings west of the Jordan and all the Canaanite kings along the coast heard how the LORD had dried up the waters of the Jordan before the Israelites until they had crossed over, their hearts melted and their spirits failed for fear of the Israelites.
</p>

<p>
<a id="5-2"></a> <b>2</b> At that time the LORD said to Joshua, “Make flint knives and circumcise the sons of Israel once again.” 
<a id="5-3"></a> <b>3</b> So Joshua made flint knives and circumcised the sons of Israel at Gibeath-haaraloth.
</p>

<p>
<a id="5-4"></a> <b>4</b> Now this is why Joshua circumcised them: All those who came out of Egypt&#x2014;all the men of war&#x2014;had died on the journey in the wilderness after they had left Egypt. 
<a id="5-5"></a> <b>5</b> Though all who had come out were circumcised, none of those born in the wilderness on the journey from Egypt had been circumcised.
</p>

<p>
<a id="5-6"></a> <b>6</b> For the Israelites had wandered in the wilderness forty years, until all the nation&rsquo;s men of war who had come out of Egypt had died, since they did not obey the LORD. So the LORD vowed never to let them see the land He had sworn to their fathers to give us, a land flowing with milk and honey. 
<a id="5-7"></a> <b>7</b> And Joshua raised up their sons in their place, and these were the ones he circumcised. Until this time they were still uncircumcised, since they had not been circumcised along the way.
</p>

<p>
<a id="5-8"></a> <b>8</b> And after all the nation had been circumcised, they stayed there in the camp until they were healed.
</p>

<p>
<a id="5-9"></a> <b>9</b> Then the LORD said to Joshua, “Today I have rolled away the reproach of Egypt from you.” So that place has been called Gilgal to this day.
</p>

<p>
<a id="5-10"></a> <b>10</b> On the evening of the fourteenth day of the month, while the Israelites were camped at Gilgal on the plains of Jericho, they kept the Passover. 
<a id="5-11"></a> <b>11</b> The day after the Passover, on that very day, they ate unleavened bread and roasted grain from the produce of the land.
</p>

<p>
<a id="5-12"></a> <b>12</b> And the day after they had eaten from the produce of the land, the manna ceased. There was no more manna for the Israelites, so that year they began to eat the crops of the land of Canaan.

<a id="5-14"></a> <b>14</b> “Neither,” He replied. “I have now come as Commander of the LORD&rsquo;s army.”

<p>
<a id="6-1"></a> Now Jericho was tightly shut up because of the Israelites. No one went out and no one came in.
</p>

<p>
<a id="6-2"></a> <b>2</b> And the LORD said to Joshua, “Behold, I have delivered Jericho into your hand, along with its king and its mighty men of valor. 
<a id="6-3"></a> <b>3</b> March around the city with all the men of war, circling the city one time. Do this for six days. 
<a id="6-4"></a> <b>4</b> Have seven priests carry seven rams&rsquo; horns in front of the ark. Then on the seventh day, march around the city seven times, while the priests blow the horns. 
<a id="6-5"></a> <b>5</b> And when there is a long blast of the ram&rsquo;s horn and you hear its sound, have all the people give a mighty shout. Then the wall of the city will collapse and all your people will charge straight into the city.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="6-6"></a> <b>6</b> So Joshua son of Nun summoned the priests and said, “Take up the ark of the covenant and have seven priests carry seven rams&rsquo; horns in front of the ark of the LORD.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="6-7"></a> <b>7</b> And he told the people, “Advance and march around the city, with the armed troops going ahead of the ark of the LORD.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="6-8"></a> <b>8</b> After Joshua had spoken to the people, seven priests carrying seven rams&rsquo; horns before the LORD advanced and blew the horns, and the ark of the covenant of the LORD followed them. 
<a id="6-9"></a> <b>9</b> While the horns continued to sound, the armed troops marched ahead of the priests who blew the horns, and the rear guard followed the ark.
</p>

<p>
<a id="6-10"></a> <b>10</b> But Joshua had commanded the people: “Do not give a battle cry or let your voice be heard; do not let one word come out of your mouth until the day I tell you to shout. Then you are to shout!” 
<a id="6-11"></a> <b>11</b> So he had the ark of the LORD carried around the city, circling it once. And the people returned to the camp and spent the night there.
</p>

<p>
<a id="6-12"></a> <b>12</b> Joshua got up early the next morning, and the priests took the ark of the LORD. 
<a id="6-13"></a> <b>13</b> And the seven priests carrying seven rams&rsquo; horns kept marching ahead of the ark of the LORD and blowing the horns. The armed troops went in front of them and the rear guard followed the ark of the LORD, while the horns kept sounding. 
<a id="6-14"></a> <b>14</b> So on the second day they marched around the city once and returned to the camp. They did this for six days.
</p>

<p>
<a id="6-15"></a> <b>15</b> Then on the seventh day, they got up at dawn and marched around the city seven times in the same manner. That was the only day they circled the city seven times. 
<a id="6-16"></a> <b>16</b> After the seventh time around, the priests blew the horns, and Joshua commanded the people, “Shout! For the LORD has given you the city! 
<a id="6-17"></a> <b>17</b> Now the city and everything in it must be devoted to the LORD for destruction. Only Rahab the prostitute and all those with her in her house will live, because she hid the spies we sent. 
<a id="6-18"></a> <b>18</b> But keep away from the things devoted to destruction, lest you yourself be set apart for destruction. If you take any of these, you will set apart the camp of Israel for destruction and bring disaster upon it. 
<a id="6-19"></a> <b>19</b> For all the silver and gold and all the articles of bronze and iron are holy to the LORD; they must go into His treasury.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="6-20"></a> <b>20</b> So when the rams&rsquo; horns sounded, the people shouted. When they heard the blast of the horn, the people gave a great shout, and the wall collapsed. Then all the people charged straight into the city and captured it. 
<a id="6-21"></a> <b>21</b> At the edge of the sword they devoted to destruction everything in the city&#x2014;man and woman, young and old, oxen, sheep, and donkeys.
</p>

<p>
<a id="6-22"></a> <b>22</b> Meanwhile, Joshua told the two men who had spied out the land, “Go into the house of the prostitute and bring out the woman and all who are with her, just as you promised her.” 
<a id="6-23"></a> <b>23</b> So the young spies went in and brought out Rahab, her father and mother and brothers, and all who belonged to her. They brought out her whole family and settled them outside the camp of Israel.
</p>

<p>
<a id="6-24"></a> <b>24</b> Then the Israelites burned up the city and everything in it. However, they put the silver and gold and articles of bronze and iron into the treasury of the LORD&rsquo;s house. 
<a id="6-25"></a> <b>25</b> And Joshua spared Rahab the prostitute, with her father&rsquo;s household and all who belonged to her, because she hid the men Joshua had sent to spy out Jericho. So she has lived among the Israelites to this day.
</p>

<p>
<a id="6-26"></a> <b>26</b> At that time Joshua invoked this solemn oath:
“Cursed before the LORD is the man who rises up
and rebuilds this city, Jericho;
at the cost of his firstborn
he will lay its foundations;
at the cost of his youngest
he will set up its gates.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="6-27"></a> <b>27</b> So the LORD was with Joshua, and his fame spread throughout the land.

</p>

<p>
<a id="7-1"></a> The Israelites, however, acted unfaithfully regarding the things devoted to destruction. Achan son of Carmi, the son of Zabdi, the son of Zerah, of the tribe of Judah, took some of what was set apart. So the anger of the LORD burned against the Israelites.
</p>

<p>
<a id="7-2"></a> <b>2</b> Meanwhile, Joshua sent men from Jericho to Ai, which is near Beth-aven to the east of Bethel, and told them, “Go up and spy out the land.” So the men went up and spied out Ai.
</p>

<p>
<a id="7-3"></a> <b>3</b> On returning to Joshua, they reported, “There is no need to send all the people; two or three thousand men are enough to go up and attack Ai. Since the people of Ai are so few, you need not wear out all our people there.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="7-4"></a> <b>4</b> So about three thousand men went up, but they fled before the men of Ai. 
<a id="7-5"></a> <b>5</b> And the men of Ai struck down about thirty-six of them, chasing them from the gate as far as the quarries and striking them down on the slopes. So the hearts of the people melted and became like water.
</p>

<p>
<a id="7-6"></a> <b>6</b> Then Joshua tore his clothes and fell facedown before the ark of the LORD until evening, as did the elders of Israel; and they all sprinkled dust on their heads.
<a id="7-7"></a> <b>7</b> “O, Lord GOD,” Joshua said, “why did You ever bring this people across the Jordan to deliver us into the hand of the Amorites to be destroyed? If only we had been content to stay on the other side of the Jordan! 
<a id="7-8"></a> <b>8</b> O Lord, what can I say, now that Israel has turned its back and run from its enemies? 
<a id="7-9"></a> <b>9</b> When the Canaanites and all who live in the land hear about this, they will surround us and wipe out our name from the earth. Then what will You do for Your great name?”
</p>

<p>
<a id="7-10"></a> <b>10</b> But the LORD said to Joshua, “Stand up! Why have you fallen on your face? 
<a id="7-11"></a> <b>11</b> Israel has sinned; they have transgressed My covenant that I commanded them, and they have taken some of what was devoted to destruction. Indeed, they have stolen and lied, and they have put these things with their own possessions. 
<a id="7-12"></a> <b>12</b> This is why the Israelites cannot stand against their enemies. They will turn their backs and run from their enemies, because they themselves have been set apart for destruction. I will no longer be with you unless you remove from among you whatever is devoted to destruction.
</p>

<p>
<a id="7-13"></a> <b>13</b> Get up and consecrate the people, saying, ‘Consecrate yourselves for tomorrow, for this is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says: Among you, O Israel, there are things devoted to destruction. You cannot stand against your enemies until you remove them. 
<a id="7-14"></a> <b>14</b> In the morning you must present yourselves tribe by tribe. The tribe that the LORD selects shall come forward clan by clan, and the clan that the LORD selects shall come forward family by family, and the family that the LORD selects shall come forward man by man. 
<a id="7-15"></a> <b>15</b> The one who is caught with the things devoted to destruction must be burned, along with all that belongs to him, because he has transgressed the covenant of the LORD and committed an outrage in Israel.&rsquo; ”

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgcaf0006">
<p>
<a id="7-16"></a> <b>16</b> So Joshua arose early the next morning and had Israel come forward tribe by tribe, and the tribe of Judah was selected. 
<a id="7-17"></a> <b>17</b> He had the clans of Judah come forward, and the clan of the Zerahites was selected. He had the clan of the Zerahites come forward, and the family of Zabdi was selected. 
<a id="7-18"></a> <b>18</b> And he had the family of Zabdi come forward man by man, and Achan son of Carmi, the son of Zabdi, the son of Zerah, of the tribe of Judah, was selected.
</p>

<p>
<a id="7-19"></a> <b>19</b> So Joshua said to Achan, “My son, give glory to the LORD, the God of Israel, and make a confession to Him. I urge you to tell me what you have done; do not hide it from me.”
<a id="7-20"></a> <b>20</b> “It is true,” Achan replied, “I have sinned against the LORD, the God of Israel. This is what I did: 
<a id="7-21"></a> <b>21</b> When I saw among the spoils a beautiful cloak from Shinar, two hundred shekels of silver, and a bar of gold weighing fifty shekels, I coveted them and took them. They are hidden in the ground inside my tent, with the silver underneath.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="7-22"></a> <b>22</b> So Joshua sent messengers who ran to the tent, and there it all was, hidden in his tent, with the silver underneath. 
<a id="7-23"></a> <b>23</b> They took the things from inside the tent, brought them to Joshua and all the Israelites, and spread them out before the LORD.
</p>

<p>
<a id="7-24"></a> <b>24</b> Then Joshua, together with all Israel, took Achan son of Zerah, the silver, the cloak, the bar of gold, his sons and daughters, his oxen and donkeys and sheep, his tent, and everything else he owned, and brought them to the Valley of Achor.
<a id="7-25"></a> <b>25</b> “Why have you brought this trouble upon us?” said Joshua. “Today the LORD will bring trouble upon you!” And all Israel stoned him to death. Then they stoned the others and burned their bodies. 
<a id="7-26"></a> <b>26</b> And they heaped over Achan a large pile of rocks that remains to this day. So the LORD turned from His burning anger. Therefore that place is called the Valley of Achor to this day.

</p>

<p>
<a id="8-1"></a> Then the LORD said to Joshua, “Do not be afraid or discouraged. Take the whole army with you, and go up and attack Ai. See, I have delivered into your hand the king of Ai, his people, his city, and his land. 
<a id="8-2"></a> <b>2</b> And you shall do to Ai and its king as you did to Jericho and its king, except that you may carry off their plunder and livestock for yourselves. Set up an ambush behind the city.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="8-3"></a> <b>3</b> So Joshua and the whole army set out to attack Ai. Joshua chose 30,000 mighty men of valor and sent them out at night 
<a id="8-4"></a> <b>4</b> with these orders: “Pay attention. You are to lie in ambush behind the city, not too far from it. All of you must be ready. 
<a id="8-5"></a> <b>5</b> Then I and all the troops with me will advance on the city. When they come out against us as they did the first time, we will flee from them. 
<a id="8-6"></a> <b>6</b> They will pursue us until we have drawn them away from the city, for they will say, ‘The Israelites are running away from us as they did before.&rsquo; So as we flee from them, 
<a id="8-7"></a> <b>7</b> you are to rise from the ambush and seize the city, for the LORD your God will deliver it into your hand. 
<a id="8-8"></a> <b>8</b> And when you have taken the city, set it on fire. Do as the LORD has commanded! See, I have given you orders.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="8-9"></a> <b>9</b> So Joshua sent them out, and they went to the place of ambush and lay in wait between Bethel and Ai, to the west of Ai. But Joshua spent that night among the people.
</p>

<p>
<a id="8-10"></a> <b>10</b> Joshua got up early the next morning and mobilized his men, and he and the elders of Israel marched before them up to Ai. 
<a id="8-11"></a> <b>11</b> Then all the troops who were with him marched up and approached the city. They arrived in front of Ai and camped to the north of it, with the valley between them and the city.
</p>

<p>
<a id="8-12"></a> <b>12</b> Now Joshua had taken about five thousand men and set up an ambush between Bethel and Ai, to the west of the city. 
<a id="8-13"></a> <b>13</b> So the forces were stationed with the main camp to the north of the city and the rear guard to the west of the city. And that night Joshua went into the valley.
</p>

<p>
<a id="8-14"></a> <b>14</b> When the king of Ai saw the Israelites, he hurried out early in the morning with the men of the city to engage them in battle at an appointed place overlooking the Arabah. But he did not know that an ambush had been set up against him behind the city. 
<a id="8-15"></a> <b>15</b> Joshua and all Israel let themselves be beaten back before them, and they fled toward the wilderness. 
<a id="8-16"></a> <b>16</b> Then all the men of Ai were summoned to pursue them, and they followed Joshua and were drawn away from the city. 
<a id="8-17"></a> <b>17</b> Not a man was left in Ai or Bethel who did not go out after Israel, leaving the city wide open while they pursued Israel.
</p>

<p>
<a id="8-18"></a> <b>18</b> Then the LORD said to Joshua, “Hold out your battle lance toward Ai, for into your hand I will deliver the city.” So Joshua held out his battle lance toward Ai, 
<a id="8-19"></a> <b>19</b> and as soon as he did so, the men in ambush rose quickly from their position. They rushed forward, entered the city, captured it, and immediately set it on fire.
</p>

<p>
<a id="8-20"></a> <b>20</b> When the men of Ai turned and looked back, the smoke of the city was rising into the sky. They could not escape in any direction, and the troops who had fled to the wilderness now became the pursuers. 
<a id="8-21"></a> <b>21</b> When Joshua and all Israel saw that the men in ambush had captured the city and that smoke was rising from it, they turned around and struck down the men of Ai. 
<a id="8-22"></a> <b>22</b> Meanwhile, those in the ambush came out of the city against them, and the men of Ai were trapped between the Israelite forces on both sides. So Israel struck them down until no survivor or fugitive remained. 
<a id="8-23"></a> <b>23</b> But they took the king of Ai alive and brought him to Joshua.
</p>

<p>
<a id="8-24"></a> <b>24</b> When Israel had finished killing all the men of Ai who had pursued them into the field and wilderness, and when every last one of them had fallen by the sword, all the Israelites returned to Ai and put it to the sword as well. 
<a id="8-25"></a> <b>25</b> A total of twelve thousand men and women fell that day&#x2014;all the people of Ai. 
<a id="8-26"></a> <b>26</b> Joshua did not draw back the hand that held his battle lance until he had devoted to destruction all who lived in Ai. 
<a id="8-27"></a> <b>27</b> Israel took for themselves only the cattle and plunder of that city, as the LORD had commanded Joshua.
</p>

<p>
<a id="8-28"></a> <b>28</b> So Joshua burned Ai and made it a permanent heap of ruins, a desolation to this day. 
<a id="8-29"></a> <b>29</b> He hung the king of Ai on a tree until evening, and at sunset Joshua commanded that they take down the body from the tree and throw it down at the entrance of the city gate. And over it they raised a large pile of rocks, which remains to this day.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgb63f02a">
<p>
<a id="8-30"></a> <b>30</b> At that time Joshua built an altar on Mount Ebal to the LORD, the God of Israel, 
<a id="8-31"></a> <b>31</b> just as Moses the servant of the LORD had commanded the Israelites. He built it according to what is written in the Book of the Law of Moses: “an altar of uncut stones on which no iron tool has been used.” And on it they offered burnt offerings to the LORD, and they sacrificed peace offerings.
</p>

<p>
<a id="8-32"></a> <b>32</b> And there in the presence of the Israelites, Joshua inscribed on the stones a copy of the law of Moses, which he had written. 
<a id="8-33"></a> <b>33</b> All Israel, foreigners and citizens alike, with their elders, officers, and judges, stood on both sides of the ark of the covenant of the LORD facing the Levitical priests who carried it.

</p>

<p>
<a id="8-34"></a> <b>34</b> Afterward, Joshua read aloud all the words of the law&#x2014;the blessings and the curses&#x2014;according to all that is written in the Book of the Law. 
<a id="8-35"></a> <b>35</b> There was not a word of all that Moses had commanded that Joshua failed to read before the whole assembly of Israel, including the women, the little ones, and the foreigners who lived among them.

<p>
<a id="9-1"></a> Now when news of this reached all the kings west of the Jordan&#x2014;those in the hill country, the foothills, and all along the coast of the Great Sea toward Lebanon (the Hittites, Amorites, Canaanites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites)&#x2014; 
<a id="9-2"></a> <b>2</b> they came together to wage war against Joshua and Israel.
</p>

<p>
<a id="9-3"></a> <b>3</b> But the people of Gibeon, having heard what Joshua had done to Jericho and Ai, 
<a id="9-4"></a> <b>4</b> acted deceptively and set out as envoys, carrying on their donkeys worn-out sacks and old wineskins, cracked and mended. 
<a id="9-5"></a> <b>5</b> They put worn, patched sandals on their feet and threadbare clothing on their bodies, and their whole supply of bread was dry and moldy. 
<a id="9-6"></a> <b>6</b> They went to Joshua in the camp at Gilgal and said to him and the men of Israel, “We have come from a distant land; please make a treaty with us.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="9-7"></a> <b>7</b> But the men of Israel said to the Hivites, “Perhaps you dwell near us. How can we make a treaty with you?”
<a id="9-8"></a> <b>8</b> “We are your servants,” they said to Joshua.
Then Joshua asked them, “Who are you and where have you come from?”
<a id="9-9"></a> <b>9</b> “Your servants have come from a very distant land,” they replied, “because of the fame of the LORD your God. For we have heard the reports about Him: all that He did in Egypt, 
<a id="9-10"></a> <b>10</b> and all that He did to the two kings of the Amorites beyond the Jordan&#x2014;Sihon king of Heshbon and Og king of Bashan, who reigned in Ashtaroth. 
<a id="9-11"></a> <b>11</b> So the elders and inhabitants of our land told us, ‘Take provisions for your journey; go to meet them and say to them: We are your servants. Please make a treaty with us.&rsquo;
</p>

<p>
<a id="9-12"></a> <b>12</b> This bread of ours was warm when we packed it at home on the day we left to come to you. But take a look, it is now dry and moldy. 
<a id="9-13"></a> <b>13</b> These wineskins were new when we filled them, but look, they are cracked. And these clothes and sandals are worn out from our very long journey.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="9-14"></a> <b>14</b> Then the men of Israel sampled their provisions, but did not seek the counsel of the LORD. 
<a id="9-15"></a> <b>15</b> And Joshua made a treaty of peace with them to let them live, and the leaders of the congregation swore an oath to them.
</p>

<p>
<a id="9-16"></a> <b>16</b> Three days after they had made the treaty with the Gibeonites, the Israelites learned that they were neighbors, living among them. 
<a id="9-17"></a> <b>17</b> So the Israelites set out and on the third day arrived at their cities&#x2014;Gibeon, Chephirah, Beeroth, and Kiriath-jearim. 
<a id="9-18"></a> <b>18</b> But the Israelites did not attack them, because the leaders of the congregation had sworn an oath to them by the LORD, the God of Israel. And the whole congregation grumbled against the leaders.
</p>

<p>
<a id="9-19"></a> <b>19</b> All the leaders answered, “We have sworn an oath to them by the LORD, the God of Israel, and now we cannot touch them. 
<a id="9-20"></a> <b>20</b> This is how we will treat them: We will let them live, so that no wrath will fall on us because of the oath we swore to them.” 
<a id="9-21"></a> <b>21</b> They continued, “Let them live, but let them be woodcutters and water carriers for the whole congregation.” So the leaders kept their promise.
</p>

<p>
<a id="9-22"></a> <b>22</b> Then Joshua summoned the Gibeonites and said, “Why did you deceive us by telling us you live far away from us, when in fact you live among us? 
<a id="9-23"></a> <b>23</b> Now therefore you are under a curse and will perpetually serve as woodcutters and water carriers for the house of my God.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="9-24"></a> <b>24</b> The Gibeonites answered, “Your servants were told clearly that the LORD your God had commanded His servant Moses to give you all the land and wipe out all its inhabitants before you. So we greatly feared for our lives because of you, and that is why we have done this. 
<a id="9-25"></a> <b>25</b> Now we are in your hands. Do to us whatever seems good and right to you.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="9-26"></a> <b>26</b> So Joshua did this and delivered them from the hands of the Israelites, and they did not kill the Gibeonites. 
<a id="9-27"></a> <b>27</b> On that day he made them woodcutters and water carriers, as they are to this day for the congregation of the LORD and for the altar at the place He would choose.

</p>

<p>
<a id="10-1"></a> Now Adoni-zedek king of Jerusalem heard that Joshua had captured Ai and devoted it to destruction &#x2014;doing to Ai and its king as he had done to Jericho and its king&#x2014;and that the people of Gibeon had made peace with Israel and were living near them. 
<a id="10-2"></a> <b>2</b> So Adoni-zedek and his people were greatly alarmed, because Gibeon was a great city, like one of the royal cities; it was larger than Ai, and all its men were mighty.
</p>

<p>
<a id="10-3"></a> <b>3</b> Therefore Adoni-zedek king of Jerusalem sent word to Hoham king of Hebron, Piram king of Jarmuth, Japhia king of Lachish, and Debir king of Eglon, saying,
<a id="10-4"></a> <b>4</b> “Come up and help me. We will attack Gibeon, because they have made peace with Joshua and the Israelites.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="10-5"></a> <b>5</b> So the five kings of the Amorites&#x2014;the kings of Jerusalem, Hebron, Jarmuth, Lachish, and Eglon&#x2014;joined forces and advanced with all their armies. They camped before Gibeon and made war against it.
</p>

<p>
<a id="10-6"></a> <b>6</b> Then the men of Gibeon sent word to Joshua in the camp at Gilgal: “Do not abandon your servants. Come quickly and save us! Help us, because all the kings of the Amorites from the hill country have joined forces against us.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="10-7"></a> <b>7</b> So Joshua and his whole army, including all the mighty men of valor, came from Gilgal.
</p>

<p>
<a id="10-8"></a> <b>8</b> The LORD said to Joshua, “Do not be afraid of them, for I have delivered them into your hand. Not one of them shall stand against you.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="10-9"></a> <b>9</b> After marching all night from Gilgal, Joshua caught them by surprise. 
<a id="10-10"></a> <b>10</b> And the LORD threw them into confusion before Israel, who defeated them in a great slaughter at Gibeon, pursued them along the ascent to Beth-horon, and struck them down as far as Azekah and Makkedah. 
<a id="10-11"></a> <b>11</b> As they fled before Israel along the descent from Beth-horon to Azekah, the LORD cast down on them large hailstones from the sky, and more of them were killed by the hailstones than by the swords of the Israelites.
</p>

<p>
<a id="10-12"></a> <b>12</b> On the day that the LORD gave the Amorites over to the Israelites, Joshua spoke to the LORD in the presence of Israel:
“O sun, stand still over Gibeon,
O moon, over the Valley of Aijalon.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="10-13"></a> <b>13</b> So the sun stood still
and the moon stopped
until the nation took vengeance
upon its enemies.
Is this not written in the Book of Jashar?
“So the sun stopped
in the middle of the sky
and delayed going down
about a full day.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="10-14"></a> <b>14</b> There has been no day like it before or since, when the LORD listened to the voice of a man, because the LORD fought for Israel.
</p>

<p>
<a id="10-15"></a> <b>15</b> Then Joshua returned with all Israel to the camp at Gilgal.
The Victory at Makkedah
</p>

<p>
<a id="10-16"></a> <b>16</b> Now the five kings had fled and hidden in the cave at Makkedah. 
<a id="10-17"></a> <b>17</b> And Joshua was informed: “The five kings have been found; they are hiding in the cave at Makkedah.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="10-18"></a> <b>18</b> So Joshua said, “Roll large stones against the mouth of the cave, and post men there to guard them. 
<a id="10-19"></a> <b>19</b> But you, do not stop there. Pursue your enemies and attack them from behind. Do not let them reach their cities, for the LORD your God has delivered them into your hand.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="10-20"></a> <b>20</b> So Joshua and the Israelites continued to inflict a terrible slaughter until they had finished them off, and the remaining survivors retreated to the fortified cities. 
<a id="10-21"></a> <b>21</b> The whole army returned safely to Joshua in the camp at Makkedah, and no one dared to utter a word against the Israelites.
</p>

<p>
<a id="10-22"></a> <b>22</b> Then Joshua said, “Open the mouth of the cave and bring those five kings out to me.” 
<a id="10-23"></a> <b>23</b> So they brought the five kings out of the cave&#x2014;the kings of Jerusalem, Hebron, Jarmuth, Lachish, and Eglon.
</p>

<p>
<a id="10-24"></a> <b>24</b> When they had brought the kings to Joshua, he summoned all the men of Israel and said to the army commanders who had accompanied him, “Come here and put your feet on the necks of these kings.”
So the commanders came forward and put their feet on their necks.
<a id="10-25"></a> <b>25</b> “Do not be afraid or discouraged,” Joshua said. “Be strong and courageous, for the LORD will do this to all the enemies you fight.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="10-26"></a> <b>26</b> After this, Joshua struck down and killed the kings, and he hung their bodies on five trees and left them there until evening. 
<a id="10-27"></a> <b>27</b> At sunset Joshua ordered that they be taken down from the trees and thrown into the cave in which they had hidden. Then large stones were placed against the mouth of the cave, and the stones are there to this day.
</p>

<p>
<a id="10-28"></a> <b>28</b> On that day Joshua captured Makkedah and put it to the sword, along with its king. He devoted to destruction everyone in the city, leaving no survivors. So he did to the king of Makkedah as he had done to the king of Jericho.

<a id="10-37"></a> <b>37</b> They captured it and put to the sword its king, all its villages, and all the people. Joshua left no survivors, just as he had done at Eglon; he devoted to destruction Hebron and everyone in it.

<p>
<a id="10-38"></a> <b>38</b> Finally Joshua and all Israel with him turned toward Debir and fought against it. 
<a id="10-39"></a> <b>39</b> And they captured Debir, its king, and all its villages. They put them to the sword and devoted to destruction everyone in the city, leaving no survivors. Joshua did to Debir and its king as he had done to Hebron and as he had done to Libnah and its king.

<p>
<a id="10-40"></a> <b>40</b> So Joshua conquered the whole region&#x2014;the hill country, the Negev, the foothills, and the slopes, together with all their kings&#x2014;leaving no survivors. He devoted to destruction everything that breathed, just as the LORD, the God of Israel, had commanded. 
<a id="10-41"></a> <b>41</b> Joshua conquered the area from Kadesh-barnea to Gaza, and the whole region of Goshen as far as Gibeon.

<a id="11-3"></a> <b>3</b> to the Canaanites in the east and west; to the Amorites, Hittites, Perizzites, and Jebusites in the hill country; and to the Hivites at the foot of Hermon in the land of Mizpah.

<p>
<a id="11-4"></a> <b>4</b> So these kings came out with all their armies, a multitude as numerous as the sand on the seashore, along with a great number of horses and chariots. 
<a id="11-5"></a> <b>5</b> All these kings joined forces and encamped at the waters of Merom to fight against Israel.
</p>

<p>
<a id="11-6"></a> <b>6</b> Then the LORD said to Joshua, “Do not be afraid of them, for by this time tomorrow I will deliver all of them slain before Israel. You are to hamstring their horses and burn up their chariots.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="11-7"></a> <b>7</b> So by the waters of Merom, Joshua and his whole army came upon them suddenly and attacked them, 
<a id="11-8"></a> <b>8</b> and the LORD delivered them into the hand of Israel, who struck them down and pursued them all the way to Greater Sidon and Misrephoth-maim, and eastward as far as the Valley of Mizpeh. They struck them down, leaving no survivors. 
<a id="11-9"></a> <b>9</b> Joshua treated them as the LORD had told him; he hamstrung their horses and burned up their chariots.

<p>
<a id="11-10"></a> <b>10</b> At that time Joshua turned back and captured Hazor and put its king to the sword, because Hazor was formerly the head of all these kingdoms. 
<a id="11-11"></a> <b>11</b> The Israelites put everyone in Hazor to the sword, devoting them to destruction. Nothing that breathed remained, and Joshua burned down Hazor itself.
</p>

<p>
<a id="11-12"></a> <b>12</b> Joshua captured all these kings and their cities and put them to the sword. He devoted them to destruction, as Moses the LORD&rsquo;s servant had commanded.

<a id="11-17"></a> <b>17</b> from Mount Halak, which rises toward Seir, as far as Baal-gad in the Valley of Lebanon at the foot of Mount Hermon. He captured all their kings and struck them down, putting them to death.

<p>
<a id="11-18"></a> <b>18</b> Joshua waged war against all these kings for a long period of time. 
<a id="11-19"></a> <b>19</b> No city made peace with the Israelites except the Hivites living in Gibeon; all others were taken in battle. 
<a id="11-20"></a> <b>20</b> For it was of the LORD to harden their hearts to engage Israel in battle, so that they would be set apart for destruction and would receive no mercy, being annihilated as the LORD had commanded Moses.
</p>

<p>
<a id="11-21"></a> <b>21</b> At that time Joshua proceeded to eliminate the Anakim from the hill country of Hebron, Debir, and Anab, and from all the hill country of Judah and of Israel. Joshua devoted them to destruction, along with their cities.

<a id="17-1"></a> Now this was the allotment for the tribe of Manasseh as Joseph&rsquo;s firstborn son, namely for Machir the firstborn of Manasseh and father of the Gileadites, who had received Gilead and Bashan because Machir was a man of war. 
<a id="17-2"></a> <b>2</b> So this allotment was for the rest of the descendants of Manasseh&#x2014;the clans of Abiezer, Helek, Asriel, Shechem, Hepher, and Shemida. These are the other male descendants of the clans of Manasseh son of Joseph.
</p>

<p>
<a id="17-3"></a> <b>3</b> But Zelophehad son of Hepher (the son of Gilead, the son of Machir, the son of Manasseh) had no sons but only daughters. These are the names of his daughters: Mahlah, Noah, Hoglah, Milcah, and Tirzah. 
<a id="17-4"></a> <b>4</b> They approached Eleazar the priest, Joshua son of Nun, and the leaders, and said, “The LORD commanded Moses to give us an inheritance among our brothers.”
So Joshua gave them an inheritance among their father&rsquo;s brothers, in keeping with the command of the LORD. 
<a id="17-5"></a> <b>5</b> Thus ten shares fell to Manasseh, in addition to the land of Gilead and Bashan beyond the Jordan, 
<a id="17-6"></a> <b>6</b> because the daughters of Manasseh received an inheritance among his sons. And the land of Gilead belonged to the rest of the sons of Manasseh.
</p>

<p>
<a id="17-7"></a> <b>7</b> Now the border of Manasseh went from Asher to Michmethath near Shechem, then southward to include the inhabitants of En-tappuah. 
<a id="17-8"></a> <b>8</b> The region of Tappuah belonged to Manasseh, but Tappuah itself, on the border of Manasseh, belonged to Ephraim. 
<a id="17-9"></a> <b>9</b> From there the border continued southward to the Brook of Kanah. There were cities belonging to Ephraim among the cities of Manasseh, but the border of Manasseh was on the north side of the brook and ended at the Sea. 
<a id="17-10"></a> <b>10</b> Ephraim&rsquo;s territory was to the south, and Manasseh&rsquo;s was to the north, having the Sea as its border and adjoining Asher on the north and Issachar on the east.
</p>

<p>
<a id="17-11"></a> <b>11</b> Within Issachar and Asher, Manasseh was assigned Beth-shean, Ibleam, Dor (that is, Naphath), Endor, Taanach, and Megiddo, each with their surrounding settlements.
</p>

<p>
<a id="17-12"></a> <b>12</b> But the descendants of Manasseh were unable to occupy these cities, because the Canaanites were determined to stay in this land. 
<a id="17-13"></a> <b>13</b> However, when the Israelites grew stronger, they put the Canaanites to forced labor; but they failed to drive them out completely.
</p>

<p>
<a id="17-14"></a> <b>14</b> Then the sons of Joseph said to Joshua, “Why have you given us only one portion as an inheritance? We have many people, because the LORD has blessed us abundantly.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="17-15"></a> <b>15</b> Joshua answered them, “If you have so many people that the hill country of Ephraim is too small for you, go to the forest and clear for yourself an area in the land of the Perizzites and the Rephaim.”
<a id="17-16"></a> <b>16</b> “The hill country is not enough for us,” they replied, “and all the Canaanites who live in the valley have iron chariots, both in Beth-shean with its towns and in the Valley of Jezreel.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="17-17"></a> <b>17</b> So Joshua said to the house of Joseph&#x2014;to Ephraim and Manasseh&#x2014;“You have many people and great strength. You shall not have just one allotment, 
<a id="17-18"></a> <b>18</b> because the hill country will be yours as well. It is a forest; clear it, and its farthest limits will be yours. Although the Canaanites have iron chariots and although they are strong, you can drive them out.”

</p>

<p>
<a id="18-3"></a> <b>3</b> So Joshua said to the Israelites, “How long will you put off entering and possessing the land that the LORD, the God of your fathers, has given you? 
<a id="18-4"></a> <b>4</b> Appoint three men from each tribe, and I will send them out to survey the land and map it out, according to the inheritance of each. Then they will return to me

<a id="18-6"></a> <b>6</b> When you have mapped out the seven portions of land and brought it to me, I will cast lots for you here in the presence of the LORD our God.

<p>
<a id="18-7"></a> <b>7</b> The Levites, however, have no portion among you, because their inheritance is the priesthood of the LORD. And Gad, Reuben, and half the tribe of Manasseh have already received the inheritance that Moses the servant of the LORD gave them beyond the Jordan to the east.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="18-8"></a> <b>8</b> As the men got up to go out, Joshua commanded them to map out the land, saying, “Go and survey the land, map it out, and return to me. Then I will cast lots for you here in Shiloh in the presence of the LORD.”

<a id="20-3"></a> <b>3</b> so that anyone who kills another unintentionally or accidentally may flee there. These will be your refuge from the avenger of blood. 
<a id="20-4"></a> <b>4</b> When someone flees to one of these cities, stands at the entrance of the city gate, and states his case before its elders, they are to bring him into the city and give him a place to live among them.

<p>
<a id="21-4"></a> <b>4</b> The first lot came out for the Kohathite clans. The Levites who were descendants of Aaron the priest received thirteen cities by lot from the tribes of Judah, Simeon, and Benjamin.

<p>
<a id="21-9"></a> <b>9</b> From the tribes of Judah and Simeon, they designated these cities by name

<p>
<a id="21-11"></a> <b>11</b> They gave them Kiriath-arba (that is, Hebron), with its surrounding pasturelands, in the hill country of Judah. (Arba was the father of Anak.)

<a id="21-13"></a> <b>13</b> So to the descendants of Aaron the priest they gave these cities, together with their pasturelands: Hebron, a city of refuge for the manslayer, Libnah,

<a id="21-15"></a> <b>15</b> Holon, Debir,

<p>
<a id="21-32"></a> <b>32</b> And from the tribe of Naphtali they were given Kedesh in Galilee (a city of refuge for the manslayer), Hammoth-dor, and Kartan&#x2014;three cities, together with their pasturelands.

<p>
<a id="21-38"></a> <b>38</b> And from the tribe of Gad they were given Ramoth in Gilead, a city of refuge for the manslayer, Mahanaim, 
<a id="21-39"></a> <b>39</b> Heshbon, and Jazer&#x2014;four cities in all, together with their pasturelands.
</p>

<p>
<a id="21-40"></a> <b>40</b> In all, twelve cities were allotted to the clans of Merari, the remaining Levite clans.

<p>
<a id="22-17"></a> <b>17</b> Was not the sin of Peor enough for us, from which we have not cleansed ourselves to this day? It even brought a plague upon the congregation of the LORD.

<a id="22-19"></a> <b>19</b> If indeed the land of your inheritance is unclean, then cross over to the land of the LORD&rsquo;s possession, where the LORD&rsquo;s tabernacle stands, and take possession of it among us.

<a id="22-20"></a> <b>20</b> Was not Achan son of Zerah unfaithful regarding what was set apart for destruction, bringing wrath upon the whole congregation of Israel? Yet it was not only Achan who perished because of his sin!&rsquo; ”
</p>

<p>
<a id="22-21"></a> <b>21</b> Then the Reubenites, the Gadites, and the half-tribe of Manasseh answered the leaders of the clans of Israel:

<a id="22-23"></a> <b>23</b> If we have built for ourselves an altar to turn away from Him and to offer burnt offerings and grain offerings on it, or to sacrifice fellowship offerings on it, may the LORD Himself hold us accountable.

<p>
<a id="22-24"></a> <b>24</b> But in fact we have done this for fear that in the future your descendants might say to ours, ‘What have you to do with the LORD, the God of Israel? 
<a id="22-25"></a> <b>25</b> For the LORD has made the Jordan a border between us and you Reubenites and Gadites. You have no share in the LORD!&rsquo; So your descendants could cause ours to stop fearing the LORD.

<p>
<a id="22-26"></a> <b>26</b> That is why we said, ‘Let us take action and build an altar for ourselves, but not for burnt offerings or sacrifices. 
<a id="22-27"></a> <b>27</b> Rather, let it be a witness between us and you and the generations to come, that we will worship the LORD in His presence with our burnt offerings, sacrifices, and peace offerings.&rsquo; Then in the future, your descendants cannot say to ours, ‘You have no share in the LORD!&rsquo;

<p>
<a id="23-1"></a> A long time after the LORD had given Israel rest from all the enemies around them, when Joshua was old and well along in years, 
<a id="23-2"></a> <b>2</b> he summoned all Israel, including its elders, leaders, judges, and officers. “I am old and well along in years,” he said,
<a id="23-3"></a> <b>3</b> “and you have seen everything that the LORD your God has done to all these nations for your sake, because it was the LORD your God who fought for you.
</p>

<p>
<a id="23-4"></a> <b>4</b> See, I have allotted as an inheritance to your tribes these remaining nations, including all the nations I have already cut off, from the Jordan westward to the Great Sea. 
<a id="23-5"></a> <b>5</b> The LORD your God will push them out of your way and drive them out before you, so that you can take possession of their land, as the LORD your God promised you.
</p>

<p>
<a id="23-6"></a> <b>6</b> Be very strong, then, so that you can keep and obey all that is written in the Book of the Law of Moses, not turning aside from it to the right or to the left. 
<a id="23-7"></a> <b>7</b> So you are not to associate with these nations that remain among you. You must not call on the names of their gods or swear by them, and you must not serve them or bow down to them. 
<a id="23-8"></a> <b>8</b> Instead, you shall hold fast to the LORD your God, as you have done to this day.
</p>

<p>
<a id="23-9"></a> <b>9</b> The LORD has driven out great and powerful nations before you, and to this day no one can stand against you. 
<a id="23-10"></a> <b>10</b> One of you can put a thousand to flight, because the LORD your God fights for you, just as He promised. 
<a id="23-11"></a> <b>11</b> Therefore watch yourselves carefully, that you love the LORD your God. 
<a id="23-12"></a> <b>12</b> For if you turn away and cling to the rest of these nations that remain among you, and if you intermarry and associate with them, 
<a id="23-13"></a> <b>13</b> know for sure that the LORD your God will no longer drive out these nations before you. Instead, they will become for you a snare and a trap, a scourge in your sides and thorns in your eyes, until you perish from this good land that the LORD your God has given you.
</p>

<p>
<a id="23-14"></a> <b>14</b> Now behold, today I am going the way of all the earth, and you know with all your heart and soul that not one of the good promises the LORD your God made to you has failed. Everything was fulfilled for you; not one promise has failed. 
<a id="23-15"></a> <b>15</b> But just as every good thing the LORD your God promised you has come to pass, likewise the LORD will bring upon you the calamity He has threatened, until He has destroyed you from this good land He has given you. 
<a id="23-16"></a> <b>16</b> If you transgress the covenant of the LORD your God, which He commanded you, and go and serve other gods and bow down to them, then the anger of the LORD will burn against you, and you will quickly perish from this good land He has given you.”

<p>
<a id="24-1"></a> Then Joshua assembled all the tribes of Israel at Shechem. He summoned the elders, leaders, judges, and officers of Israel, and they presented themselves before God.
</p>

<p>
<a id="24-2"></a> <b>2</b> And Joshua said to all the people, “This is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says: ‘Long ago your fathers, including Terah the father of Abraham and Nahor, lived beyond the Euphrates and worshiped other gods. 
<a id="24-3"></a> <b>3</b> But I took your father Abraham from beyond the Euphrates and led him through all the land of Canaan, and I multiplied his descendants. I gave him Isaac, 
<a id="24-4"></a> <b>4</b> and to Isaac I gave Jacob and Esau. I gave Esau Mount Seir to possess, but Jacob and his sons went down to Egypt.
</p>

<p>
<a id="24-5"></a> <b>5</b> Then I sent Moses and Aaron, and I afflicted the Egyptians by what I did there, and afterward I brought you out. 
<a id="24-6"></a> <b>6</b> When I brought your fathers out of Egypt and you reached the Red Sea, the Egyptians pursued them with chariots and horsemen as far as the Red Sea. 
<a id="24-7"></a> <b>7</b> So your fathers cried out to the LORD, and He put darkness between you and the Egyptians, over whom He brought the sea and engulfed them. Your very eyes saw what I did to the Egyptians. Then you lived in the wilderness for a long time.
</p>

<p>
<a id="24-8"></a> <b>8</b> Later, I brought you to the land of the Amorites who lived beyond the Jordan. They fought against you, but I delivered them into your hand, that you should possess their land when I destroyed them before you. 
<a id="24-9"></a> <b>9</b> Then Balak son of Zippor, the king of Moab, set out to fight against Israel. He sent for Balaam son of Beor to curse you, 
<a id="24-10"></a> <b>10</b> but I would not listen to Balaam. So he blessed you again and again, and I delivered you from his hand.
</p>

<p>
<a id="24-11"></a> <b>11</b> After this, you crossed the Jordan and came to Jericho. The people of Jericho fought against you, as did the Amorites, Perizzites, Canaanites, Hittites, Girgashites, Hivites, and Jebusites, and I delivered them into your hand. 
<a id="24-12"></a> <b>12</b> I sent the hornet ahead of you, and it drove out the two Amorite kings before you, but not by your own sword or bow. 
<a id="24-13"></a> <b>13</b> So I gave you a land on which you did not toil and cities that you did not build, and now you live in them and eat from vineyards and olive groves that you did not plant.&rsquo;

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org1b7c54b">
<p>
<a id="24-14"></a> <b>14</b> Now, therefore, fear the LORD and serve Him in sincerity and truth; cast aside the gods your fathers served beyond the Euphrates and in Egypt, and serve the LORD. 
<a id="24-15"></a> <b>15</b> But if it is unpleasing in your sight to serve the LORD, then choose for yourselves this day whom you will serve, whether the gods your fathers served beyond the Euphrates, or the gods of the Amorites in whose land you are living. As for me and my house, we will serve the LORD!”
</p>

<p>
<a id="24-16"></a> <b>16</b> The people replied, “Far be it from us to forsake the LORD to serve other gods! 
<a id="24-17"></a> <b>17</b> For the LORD our God brought us and our fathers out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of slavery, and performed these great signs before our eyes. He also protected us throughout our journey and among all the nations through which we traveled. 
<a id="24-18"></a> <b>18</b> And the LORD drove out before us all the nations, including the Amorites who lived in the land. We too will serve the LORD, because He is our God!”
</p>

<p>
<a id="24-19"></a> <b>19</b> But Joshua said to the people, “You are not able to serve the LORD, for He is a holy God; He is a jealous God; He will not forgive your rebellion or your sins. 
<a id="24-20"></a> <b>20</b> If you forsake the LORD and serve foreign gods, He will turn and bring disaster on you and consume you, even after He has been good to you.”
<a id="24-21"></a> <b>21</b> “No!” replied the people. “We will serve the LORD!”
</p>

<p>
<a id="24-22"></a> <b>22</b> Then Joshua told them, “You are witnesses against yourselves that you have chosen to serve the LORD.”
“We are witnesses!” they said.
<a id="24-23"></a> <b>23</b> “Now, therefore,” he said, “get rid of the foreign gods among you and incline your hearts to the LORD, the God of Israel.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="24-24"></a> <b>24</b> So the people said to Joshua, “We will serve the LORD our God and obey His voice.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="24-25"></a> <b>25</b> On that day Joshua made a covenant for the people, and there at Shechem he established for them a statute and ordinance. 
<a id="24-26"></a> <b>26</b> Joshua recorded these things in the Book of the Law of God. Then he took a large stone and set it up there under the oak that was near the sanctuary of the LORD. 
<a id="24-27"></a> <b>27</b> And Joshua said to all the people, “You see this stone. It will be a witness against us, for it has heard all the words the LORD has spoken to us, and it will be a witness against you if you ever deny your God.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="24-28"></a> <b>28</b> Then Joshua sent the people away, each to his own inheritance.

<a id="24-29"></a> <b>29</b> Some time later, Joshua son of Nun, the servant of the LORD, died at the age of 110. 
<a id="24-30"></a> <b>30</b> And they buried him in the land of his inheritance, at Timnath-serah in the hill country of Ephraim, north of Mount Gaash. 
<a id="24-31"></a> <b>31</b> Israel had served the LORD throughout the days of Joshua and of the elders who outlived him and who had experienced all the works that the LORD had done for Israel.
</p>

<p>
<a id="24-32"></a> <b>32</b> And the bones of Joseph, which the Israelites had brought up out of Egypt, were buried at Shechem in the plot of land that Jacob had purchased from the sons of Hamor, Shechem&rsquo;s father, for a hundred pieces of silver. So it became an inheritance for Joseph&rsquo;s descendants.
</p>

<p>
<a id="24-33"></a> <b>33</b> Eleazar son of Aaron also died, and they buried him at Gibeah, which had been given to his son Phinehas in the hill country of Ephraim.

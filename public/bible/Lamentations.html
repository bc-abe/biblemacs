<p>
once so full of people!
</p>

<p>
She who was great among the nations

has become a widow.
</p>

<p>
The princess of the provinces
</p>

<p>
has become a slave.
</p>

<p>
<a id="1-2"></a> <b>2</b> She weeps aloud in the night,

<p>
with tears upon her cheeks.

Among all her lovers

there is no one to comfort her.

<p>
All her friends have betrayed her;

they have become her enemies.

<a id="1-3"></a> <b>3</b> Judah has gone into exile
</p>

<p>
under affliction and harsh slavery;

she dwells among the nations

but finds no place to rest.

<p>
All her pursuers have overtaken her

<p>
in the midst of her distress.
</p>

<p>
<a id="1-4"></a> <b>4</b> The roads to Zion mourn,

<p>
because no one comes to her appointed feasts.
</p>

<p>
All her gates are deserted;

<p>
her priests groan,
</p>

<p>
her maidens grieve,
</p>

<p>
and she herself is bitter with anguish.
</p>

<p>
<a id="1-5"></a> <b>5</b> Her foes have become her masters;

<p>
her enemies are at ease.
</p>

<p>
For the LORD has brought her grief

because of her many transgressions.
</p>

<p>
Her children have gone away
</p>

<p>
as captives before the enemy.
</p>

<p>
<a id="1-6"></a> <b>6</b> All the splendor has departed
</p>

<p>
from the Daughter of Zion.

<p>
Her princes are like deer

that find no pasture;

she received no help.

<p>
<a id="1-8"></a> <b>8</b> Jerusalem has sinned greatly;

<p>
therefore she has become an object of scorn.

All who honored her now despise her,

she herself groans and turns away.

Her downfall was astounding;

there was no one to comfort her.

<p>
Look, O LORD, on my affliction,

for the enemy has triumphed!
</p>

<p>
<a id="1-10"></a> <b>10</b> The adversary has seized

all her treasures.

He spread a net for my feet

<a id="1-15"></a> <b>15</b> The Lord has rejected

<p>
all the mighty men in my midst;

<p>
He has summoned an army against me

<p>
to crush my young warriors.
</p>

<p>
Like grapes in a winepress,

<p>
the Lord has trampled the Virgin Daughter of Judah.
</p>

<p>
<a id="1-16"></a> <b>16</b> For these things I weep;

<p>
my eyes flow with tears.

For there is no one nearby to comfort me,

no one to revive my soul.
</p>

<p>
My children are destitute

because the enemy has prevailed.
</p>

<p>
<a id="1-17"></a> <b>17</b> Zion stretches out her hands,
</p>

<p>
but there is no one to comfort her.
</p>

<p>
The LORD has decreed against Jacob
</p>

<p>
that his neighbors become his foes.
</p>

<p>
Jerusalem has become
</p>

<p>
an unclean thing among them.
</p>

<p>
<a id="1-18"></a> <b>18</b> The LORD is righteous,

<p>
for I have rebelled against His command.

<p>
Listen, all you people;

<p>
My young men and maidens

have gone into captivity.

<a id="1-19"></a> <b>19</b> I called out to my lovers,

My priests and elders

<a id="1-20"></a> <b>20</b> See, O LORD, how distressed I am!

<p>
I am churning within;

<p>
my heart is pounding within me,

<p>
for I have been most rebellious.

<p>
Outside, the sword bereaves;

All my enemies have heard of my trouble;

He has multiplied mourning and lamentation

The LORD has made Zion forget

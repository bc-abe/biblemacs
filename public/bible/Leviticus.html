</p>

<p>
<a id="1-3"></a> <b>3</b> If one&rsquo;s offering is a burnt offering from the herd, he is to present an unblemished male. He must bring it to the entrance to the Tent of Meeting for its acceptance before the LORD.

<a id="1-8"></a> <b>8</b> Then Aaron&rsquo;s sons the priests are to arrange the pieces, including the head and the fat, atop the burning wood on the altar. 
<a id="1-9"></a> <b>9</b> The entrails and legs must be washed with water, and the priest shall burn all of it on the altar as a burnt offering, an offering made by fire, a pleasing aroma to the LORD.

<a id="1-10"></a> <b>10</b> If, however, one&rsquo;s offering is a burnt offering from the flock&#x2014;from the sheep or goats&#x2014;he is to present an unblemished male.

<a id="4-1"></a> Then the LORD said to Moses,
<a id="4-2"></a> <b>2</b> “Tell the Israelites to do as follows with one who sins unintentionally against any of the LORD&rsquo;s commandments and does what is forbidden by them:
</p>

<p>
<a id="4-3"></a> <b>3</b> If the anointed priest sins, bringing guilt on the people, he must bring to the LORD a young bull without blemish as a sin offering for the sin he has committed. 
<a id="4-4"></a> <b>4</b> He must bring the bull to the entrance to the Tent of Meeting before the LORD, lay his hand on the bull&rsquo;s head, and slaughter it before the LORD. 
<a id="4-5"></a> <b>5</b> Then the anointed priest shall take some of the bull&rsquo;s blood and bring it into the Tent of Meeting. 
<a id="4-6"></a> <b>6</b> The priest is to dip his finger in the blood and sprinkle some of it seven times before the LORD, in front of the veil of the sanctuary. 
<a id="4-7"></a> <b>7</b> The priest must then put some of the blood on the horns of the altar of fragrant incense that is before the LORD in the Tent of Meeting. And he is to pour out the rest of the bull&rsquo;s blood at the base of the altar of burnt offering at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting. 
<a id="4-8"></a> <b>8</b> Then he shall remove all the fat from the bull of the sin offering&#x2014;the fat that covers the entrails, all the fat that is on them, 
<a id="4-9"></a> <b>9</b> both kidneys with the fat on them near the loins, and the lobe of the liver, which he is to remove with the kidneys&#x2014; 
<a id="4-10"></a> <b>10</b> just as the fat is removed from the ox of the peace offering. Then the priest shall burn them on the altar of burnt offering. 
<a id="4-11"></a> <b>11</b> But the hide of the bull and all its flesh, with its head and legs and its entrails and dung&#x2014; 
<a id="4-12"></a> <b>12</b> all the rest of the bull&#x2014;he must take outside the camp to a ceremonially clean place where the ashes are poured out, and there he must burn it on a wood fire on the ash heap.

<p>
<a id="4-13"></a> <b>13</b> Now if the whole congregation of Israel strays unintentionally and the matter escapes the notice of the assembly so that they violate any of the LORD&rsquo;s commandments and incur guilt by doing what is forbidden, 
<a id="4-14"></a> <b>14</b> when they become aware of the sin they have committed, then the assembly must bring a young bull as a sin offering and present it before the Tent of Meeting. 
<a id="4-15"></a> <b>15</b> The elders of the congregation are to lay their hands on the bull&rsquo;s head before the LORD, and it shall be slaughtered before the LORD. 
<a id="4-16"></a> <b>16</b> Then the anointed priest is to bring some of the bull&rsquo;s blood into the Tent of Meeting, 
<a id="4-17"></a> <b>17</b> and he is to dip his finger in the blood and sprinkle it seven times before the LORD in front of the veil. 
<a id="4-18"></a> <b>18</b> He is also to put some of the blood on the horns of the altar that is before the LORD in the Tent of Meeting, and he must pour out the rest of the blood at the base of the altar of burnt offering at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting. 
<a id="4-19"></a> <b>19</b> And he is to remove all the fat from it and burn it on the altar.

</p>

<p>
<a id="4-22"></a> <b>22</b> When a leader sins unintentionally and does what is prohibited by any of the commandments of the LORD his God, he incurs guilt. 
<a id="4-23"></a> <b>23</b> When he becomes aware of the sin he has committed, he must bring an unblemished male goat as his offering. 
<a id="4-24"></a> <b>24</b> He is to lay his hand on the head of the goat and slaughter it at the place where the burnt offering is slaughtered before the LORD. It is a sin offering.

<a id="4-27"></a> <b>27</b> And if one of the common people sins unintentionally and does what is prohibited by any of the LORD&rsquo;s commandments, he incurs guilt. 
<a id="4-28"></a> <b>28</b> When he becomes aware of the sin he has committed, he must bring an unblemished female goat as his offering for that sin. 
<a id="4-29"></a> <b>29</b> He is to lay his hand on the head of the sin offering and slaughter it at the place of the burnt offering. 
<a id="4-30"></a> <b>30</b> Then the priest is to take some of its blood with his finger, put it on the horns of the altar of burnt offering, and pour out the rest of the blood at the base of the altar. 
<a id="4-31"></a> <b>31</b> Then he is to remove all the fat, just as it is removed from the peace offering, and the priest is to burn it on the altar as a pleasing aroma to the LORD. In this way the priest will make atonement for him, and he will be forgiven.
</p>

<p>
<a id="4-32"></a> <b>32</b> If, however, he brings a lamb as a sin offering, he must bring an unblemished female. 
<a id="4-33"></a> <b>33</b> And he is to lay his hand on the head of the sin offering and slaughter it as a sin offering at the place where the burnt offering is slaughtered. 
<a id="4-34"></a> <b>34</b> Then the priest is to take some of the blood of the sin offering with his finger, put it on the horns of the altar of burnt offering, and pour out the rest of its blood at the base of the altar. 
<a id="4-35"></a> <b>35</b> And he shall remove all the fat, just as the fat of the lamb is removed from the peace offerings, and he shall burn it on the altar along with the offerings made by fire to the LORD.

<a id="6-16"></a> <b>16</b> Aaron and his sons are to eat the remainder. It must be eaten without leaven in a holy place; they are to eat it in the courtyard of the Tent of Meeting.

<a id="10-9"></a> <b>9</b> “You and your sons are not to drink wine or strong drink when you enter the Tent of Meeting, or else you will die; this is a permanent statute for the generations to come. 
<a id="10-10"></a> <b>10</b> You must distinguish between the holy and the common, between the clean and the unclean, 
<a id="10-11"></a> <b>11</b> so that you may teach the Israelites all the statutes that the LORD has given them through Moses.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="10-12"></a> <b>12</b> And Moses said to Aaron and his remaining sons, Eleazar and Ithamar, “Take the grain offering that remains from the offerings made by fire to the LORD and eat it without leaven beside the altar, because it is most holy. 
<a id="10-13"></a> <b>13</b> You shall eat it in a holy place, because it is your share and your sons&rsquo; share of the offerings made by fire to the LORD; for this is what I have been commanded.
</p>

<p>
<a id="10-14"></a> <b>14</b> And you and your sons and daughters may eat the breast of the wave offering and the thigh of the contribution in a ceremonially clean place, because these portions have been assigned to you and your children from the peace offerings of the sons of Israel. 
<a id="10-15"></a> <b>15</b> They are to bring the thigh of the contribution and the breast of the wave offering, together with the fat portions of the offerings made by fire, to wave as a wave offering before the LORD. It will belong permanently to you and your children, as the LORD has commanded.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="10-16"></a> <b>16</b> Later, Moses searched carefully for the goat of the sin offering, and behold, it had been burned up. He was angry with Eleazar and Ithamar, Aaron&rsquo;s remaining sons, and asked,
<a id="10-17"></a> <b>17</b> “Why didn&rsquo;t you eat the sin offering in the holy place? For it is most holy; it was given to you to take away the guilt of the congregation by making atonement for them before the LORD. 
<a id="10-18"></a> <b>18</b> Since its blood was not brought inside the holy place, you should have eaten it in the sanctuary area, as I commanded.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="10-19"></a> <b>19</b> But Aaron replied to Moses, “Behold, this very day they presented their sin offering and their burnt offering before the LORD. Since these things have happened to me, if I had eaten the sin offering today, would it have been acceptable in the sight of the LORD?”
</p>

<p>
<a id="10-20"></a> <b>20</b> And when Moses heard this explanation, he was satisfied.

</p>

<p>
<a id="13-4"></a> <b>4</b> If, however, the spot on his skin is white and does not appear to be deeper than the skin, and the hair in it has not turned white, the priest shall isolate the infected person for seven days.

<a id="13-8"></a> <b>8</b> The priest will reexamine him, and if the rash has spread on the skin, the priest must pronounce him unclean; he has a skin disease.
</p>

<p>
<a id="13-9"></a> <b>9</b> When anyone develops a skin disease, he must be brought to the priest. 
<a id="13-10"></a> <b>10</b> The priest will examine him, and if there is a white swelling on the skin that has turned the hair white, and there is raw flesh in the swelling,

<a id="13-20"></a> <b>20</b> The priest shall examine it, and if it appears to be beneath the skin and the hair in it has turned white, the priest shall pronounce him unclean; it is a diseased infection that has broken out in the boil.

<a id="13-23"></a> <b>23</b> But if the spot remains unchanged and does not spread, it is only the scar from the boil, and the priest shall pronounce him clean.

<a id="13-29"></a> <b>29</b> If a man or woman has an infection on the head or chin, 
<a id="13-30"></a> <b>30</b> the priest shall examine the infection, and if it appears to be deeper than the skin and the hair in it is yellow and thin, the priest must pronounce him unclean; it is a scaly outbreak, an infectious disease of the head or chin.
</p>

<p>
<a id="13-31"></a> <b>31</b> But if the priest examines the scaly infection and it does not appear to be deeper than the skin, and there is no black hair in it, the priest shall isolate the infected person for seven days. 
<a id="13-32"></a> <b>32</b> On the seventh day the priest is to reexamine the infection, and if the scaly outbreak has not spread and there is no yellow hair in it, and it does not appear to be deeper than the skin, 
<a id="13-33"></a> <b>33</b> then the person must shave himself except for the scaly area. Then the priest shall isolate him for another seven days.

<a id="13-35"></a> <b>35</b> If, however, the scaly outbreak spreads further on the skin after his cleansing, 
<a id="13-36"></a> <b>36</b> the priest is to examine him, and if the scaly outbreak has spread on the skin, the priest need not look for yellow hair; the person is unclean.
</p>

<p>
<a id="13-37"></a> <b>37</b> If, however, in his sight the scaly outbreak is unchanged and black hair has grown in it, then it has healed. He is clean, and the priest is to pronounce him clean.
</p>

<p>
<a id="13-38"></a> <b>38</b> When a man or a woman has white spots on the skin, 
<a id="13-39"></a> <b>39</b> the priest shall examine them, and if the spots are dull white, it is a harmless rash that has broken out on the skin; the person is clean.
</p>

<p>
<a id="13-40"></a> <b>40</b> Now if a man loses his hair and is bald, he is still clean. 
<a id="13-41"></a> <b>41</b> Or if his hairline recedes and he is bald on his forehead, he is still clean. 
<a id="13-42"></a> <b>42</b> But if there is a reddish-white sore on the bald head or forehead, it is an infectious disease breaking out on it. 
<a id="13-43"></a> <b>43</b> The priest is to examine him, and if the swelling of the infection on his bald head or forehead is reddish-white like a skin disease, 
<a id="13-44"></a> <b>44</b> the man is diseased; he is unclean. The priest must pronounce him unclean because of the infection on his head.
</p>

<p>
<a id="13-45"></a> <b>45</b> A diseased person must wear torn clothes and let his hair hang loose, and he must cover his mouth and cry out, ‘Unclean, unclean!&rsquo; 
<a id="13-46"></a> <b>46</b> As long as he has the infection, he remains unclean. He must live alone in a place outside the camp.

</p>

<p>
<a id="16-3"></a> <b>3</b> This is how Aaron is to enter the Holy Place: with a young bull for a sin offering and a ram for a burnt offering. 
<a id="16-4"></a> <b>4</b> He is to wear the sacred linen tunic, with linen undergarments. He must tie a linen sash around him and put on the linen turban. These are holy garments, and he must bathe himself with water before he wears them. 
<a id="16-5"></a> <b>5</b> And he shall take from the congregation of Israel two male goats for a sin offering and one ram for a burnt offering.
</p>

<p>
<a id="16-6"></a> <b>6</b> Aaron is to present the bull for his sin offering and make atonement for himself and his household. 
<a id="16-7"></a> <b>7</b> Then he shall take the two goats and present them before the LORD at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting.

<p>
<a id="16-8"></a> <b>8</b> After Aaron casts lots for the two goats, one for the LORD and the other for the scapegoat, 
<a id="16-9"></a> <b>9</b> he shall present the goat chosen by lot for the LORD and sacrifice it as a sin offering. 
<a id="16-10"></a> <b>10</b> But the goat chosen by lot as the scapegoat shall be presented alive before the LORD to make atonement by sending it into the wilderness as the scapegoat.

<a id="16-12"></a> <b>12</b> Then he must take a censer full of burning coals from the altar before the LORD, and two handfuls of finely ground fragrant incense, and take them inside the veil. 
<a id="16-13"></a> <b>13</b> He is to put the incense on the fire before the LORD, and the cloud of incense will cover the mercy seat above the Testimony, so that he will not die.

He is to put them on the goat&rsquo;s head and send it away into the wilderness by the hand of a man appointed for the task. 
<a id="16-22"></a> <b>22</b> The goat will carry on itself all their iniquities into a solitary place, and the man will release it into the wilderness.

<p>
<a id="22-3"></a> <b>3</b> Tell them that for the generations to come, if any of their descendants in a state of uncleanness approaches the sacred offerings that the Israelites consecrate to the LORD, that person must be cut off from My presence. I am the LORD.
</p>

<p>
<a id="22-4"></a> <b>4</b> If a descendant of Aaron has a skin disease or a discharge, he may not eat the sacred offerings until he is clean. Whoever touches anything defiled by a corpse or by a man who has an emission of semen,

<a id="22-6"></a> <b>6</b> the man who touches any of these will remain unclean until evening. He must not eat from the sacred offerings unless he has bathed himself with water.
</p>

<p>
<a id="22-7"></a> <b>7</b> When the sun has set, he will become clean, and then he may eat from the sacred offerings, for they are his food. 
<a id="22-8"></a> <b>8</b> He must not eat anything found dead or torn by wild animals, which would make him unclean. I am the LORD. 
<a id="22-9"></a> <b>9</b> The priests must keep My charge, lest they bear the guilt and die because they profane it. I am the LORD who sanctifies them.
</p>

<p>
<a id="22-10"></a> <b>10</b> No one outside a priest&rsquo;s family may eat the sacred offering, nor may the guest of a priest or his hired hand eat it. 
<a id="22-11"></a> <b>11</b> But if a priest buys a slave with his own money, or if a slave is born in his household, that slave may eat his food.
</p>

<p>
<a id="22-12"></a> <b>12</b> If the priest&rsquo;s daughter is married to a man other than a priest, she is not to eat of the sacred contributions. 
<a id="22-13"></a> <b>13</b> But if a priest&rsquo;s daughter with no children becomes widowed or divorced and returns to her father&rsquo;s house, she may share her father&rsquo;s food as in her youth. But no outsider may share it.
</p>

<p>
<a id="22-14"></a> <b>14</b> If anyone eats a sacred offering in error, he must add a fifth to its value and give the sacred offering to the priest. 
<a id="22-15"></a> <b>15</b> The priests must not profane the sacred offerings that the Israelites present to the LORD 
<a id="22-16"></a> <b>16</b> by allowing the people to eat the sacred offerings and thus to bear the punishment for guilt. For I am the LORD who sanctifies them.”

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org7bfb6ff">
<p>
<a id="25-23"></a> <b>23</b> The land must not be sold permanently, because it is Mine, and you are but foreigners and residents with Me. 
<a id="25-24"></a> <b>24</b> Thus for every piece of property you possess, you must provide for the redemption of the land.
</p>

<p>
<a id="25-25"></a> <b>25</b> If your brother becomes impoverished and sells some of his property, his nearest of kin may come and redeem what his brother has sold. 
<a id="25-26"></a> <b>26</b> Or if a man has no one to redeem it for him, but he prospers and acquires enough to redeem his land, 
<a id="25-27"></a> <b>27</b> he shall calculate the years since its sale, repay the balance to the man to whom he sold it, and return to his property. 
<a id="25-28"></a> <b>28</b> But if he cannot obtain enough to repay him, what he sold will remain in possession of the buyer until the Year of Jubilee. In the Jubilee, however, it is to be released, so that he may return to his property.
</p>

<p>
<a id="25-29"></a> <b>29</b> If a man sells a house in a walled city, he retains his right of redemption until a full year after its sale; during that year it may be redeemed. 
<a id="25-30"></a> <b>30</b> If it is not redeemed by the end of a full year, then the house in the walled city is permanently transferred to its buyer and his descendants. It is not to be released in the Jubilee. 
<a id="25-31"></a> <b>31</b> But houses in villages with no walls around them are to be considered as open fields. They may be redeemed, and they shall be released in the Jubilee.
</p>

<p>
<a id="25-32"></a> <b>32</b> As for the cities of the Levites, the Levites always have the right to redeem their houses in the cities they possess. 
<a id="25-33"></a> <b>33</b> So whatever belongs to the Levites may be redeemed&#x2014;a house sold in a city they possess&#x2014;and must be released in the Jubilee, because the houses in the cities of the Levites are their possession among the Israelites. 
<a id="25-34"></a> <b>34</b> But the open pastureland around their cities may not be sold, for this is their permanent possession.

</p>

<p>
<a id="27-1"></a> Then the LORD said to Moses,
<a id="27-2"></a> <b>2</b> “Speak to the Israelites and say to them, ‘When someone makes a special vow to the LORD involving the value of persons, 
<a id="27-3"></a> <b>3</b> if the valuation concerns a male from twenty to sixty years of age, then your valuation shall be fifty shekels of silver, according to the sanctuary shekel. 
<a id="27-4"></a> <b>4</b> Or if it is a female, then your valuation shall be thirty shekels. 
<a id="27-5"></a> <b>5</b> And if the person is from five to twenty years of age, then your valuation for the male shall be twenty shekels, and for the female ten shekels.
</p>

<p>
<a id="27-6"></a> <b>6</b> Now if the person is from one month to five years of age, then your valuation for the male shall be five shekels of silver, and for the female three shekels of silver. 
<a id="27-7"></a> <b>7</b> And if the person is sixty years of age or older, then your valuation shall be fifteen shekels for the male and ten shekels for the female. 
<a id="27-8"></a> <b>8</b> But if the one making the vow is too poor to pay the valuation, he is to present the person before the priest, who shall set the value according to what the one making the vow can afford.
</p>

<p>
<a id="27-9"></a> <b>9</b> If he vows an animal that may be brought as an offering to the LORD, any such animal given to the LORD shall be holy. 
<a id="27-10"></a> <b>10</b> He must not replace it or exchange it, either good for bad or bad for good. But if he does substitute one animal for another, both that animal and its substitute will be holy.
</p>

<p>
<a id="27-11"></a> <b>11</b> But if the vow involves any of the unclean animals that may not be brought as an offering to the LORD, the animal must be presented before the priest. 
<a id="27-12"></a> <b>12</b> The priest shall set its value, whether high or low; as the priest values it, the price will be set. 
<a id="27-13"></a> <b>13</b> If, however, the owner decides to redeem the animal, he must add a fifth to its value.
</p>

<p>
<a id="27-14"></a> <b>14</b> Now if a man consecrates his house as holy to the LORD, then the priest shall value it either as good or bad. The price will stand just as the priest values it. 
<a id="27-15"></a> <b>15</b> But if he who consecrated his house redeems it, he must add a fifth to the assessed value, and it will belong to him.
</p>

<p>
<a id="27-16"></a> <b>16</b> If a man consecrates to the LORD a parcel of his land, then your valuation shall be proportional to the seed required for it&#x2014;fifty shekels of silver for every homer of barley seed. 
<a id="27-17"></a> <b>17</b> If he consecrates his field during the Year of Jubilee, the price will stand according to your valuation.
</p>

<p>
<a id="27-18"></a> <b>18</b> But if he consecrates his field after the Jubilee, the priest is to calculate the price in proportion to the years left until the next Year of Jubilee, so that your valuation will be reduced. 
<a id="27-19"></a> <b>19</b> And if the one who consecrated the field decides to redeem it, he must add a fifth to the assessed value, and it shall belong to him.
</p>

<p>
<a id="27-20"></a> <b>20</b> If, however, he does not redeem the field, or if he has sold it to another man, it may no longer be redeemed. 
<a id="27-21"></a> <b>21</b> When the field is released in the Jubilee, it will become holy, like a field devoted to the LORD; it becomes the property of the priests.
</p>

<p>
<a id="27-22"></a> <b>22</b> Now if a man consecrates to the LORD a field he has purchased, which is not a part of his own property, 
<a id="27-23"></a> <b>23</b> then the priest shall calculate for him the value up to the Year of Jubilee, and the man shall pay the assessed value on that day as a sacred offering to the LORD. 
<a id="27-24"></a> <b>24</b> In the Year of Jubilee the field shall return to the one from whom it was bought&#x2014;the original owner of the land. 
<a id="27-25"></a> <b>25</b> Every valuation will be according to the sanctuary shekel, twenty gerahs to the shekel.
</p>

<p>
<a id="27-26"></a> <b>26</b> But no one may consecrate a firstborn of the livestock, because a firstborn belongs to the LORD. Whether it is an ox or a sheep, it is the LORD&rsquo;s. 
<a id="27-27"></a> <b>27</b> But if it is among the unclean animals, then he may redeem it according to your valuation and add a fifth of its value. If it is not redeemed, then it shall be sold according to your valuation.
</p>

<p>
<a id="27-28"></a> <b>28</b> Nothing that a man sets apart to the LORD from all he owns&#x2014;whether a man, an animal, or his inherited land&#x2014;can be sold or redeemed; everything so devoted is most holy to the LORD.
</p>

<p>
<a id="27-29"></a> <b>29</b> No person set apart for destruction may be ransomed; he must surely be put to death.

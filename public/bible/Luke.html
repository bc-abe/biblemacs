<p>
<a id="1-5"></a> <b>5</b> In the time of Herod king of Judea there was a priest named Zechariah, who belonged to the priestly division of Abijah, and whose wife Elizabeth was a daughter of Aaron. 
<a id="1-6"></a> <b>6</b> Both of them were righteous in the sight of God, walking blamelessly in all the commandments and decrees of the Lord. 
<a id="1-7"></a> <b>7</b> But they had no children, because Elizabeth was barren, and they were both well along in years.
</p>

<p>
<a id="1-8"></a> <b>8</b> One day while Zechariah&rsquo;s division was on duty and he was serving as priest before God, 
<a id="1-9"></a> <b>9</b> he was chosen by lot, according to the custom of the priesthood, to enter the temple of the Lord and burn incense. 
<a id="1-10"></a> <b>10</b> And at the hour of the incense offering, the whole congregation was praying outside.
</p>

<p>
<a id="1-11"></a> <b>11</b> Just then an angel of the Lord appeared to Zechariah, standing at the right side of the altar of incense. 
<a id="1-12"></a> <b>12</b> When Zechariah saw him, he was startled and gripped with fear.
</p>

<p>
<a id="1-13"></a> <b>13</b> But the angel said to him, “Do not be afraid, Zechariah, because your prayer has been heard. Your wife Elizabeth will bear you a son, and you are to give him the name John. 
<a id="1-14"></a> <b>14</b> He will be a joy and delight to you, and many will rejoice at his birth, 
<a id="1-15"></a> <b>15</b> for he will be great in the sight of the Lord. He shall never take wine or strong drink, and he will be filled with the Holy Spirit even from his mother&rsquo;s womb. 
<a id="1-16"></a> <b>16</b> Many of the sons of Israel he will turn back to the Lord their God. 
<a id="1-17"></a> <b>17</b> And he will go on before the Lord in the spirit and power of Elijah, to turn the hearts of the fathers to their children and the disobedient to the wisdom of the righteous&#x2014;to make ready a people prepared for the Lord.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="1-18"></a> <b>18</b> “How can I be sure of this?” Zechariah asked the angel. “I am an old man, and my wife is well along in years.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="1-19"></a> <b>19</b> “I am Gabriel,” replied the angel. “I stand in the presence of God, and I have been sent to speak to you and to bring you this good news. 
<a id="1-20"></a> <b>20</b> And now you will be silent and unable to speak until the day this comes to pass, because you did not believe my words, which will be fulfilled at their proper time.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="1-21"></a> <b>21</b> Meanwhile, the people were waiting for Zechariah and wondering why he took so long in the temple. 
<a id="1-22"></a> <b>22</b> When he came out and was unable to speak to them, they realized he had seen a vision in the temple. He kept making signs to them but remained speechless. 
<a id="1-23"></a> <b>23</b> And when the days of his service were complete, he returned home.
</p>

<p>
<a id="1-24"></a> <b>24</b> After these days, his wife Elizabeth became pregnant and for five months remained in seclusion. She declared,
<a id="1-25"></a> <b>25</b> “The Lord has done this for me. In these days He has shown me favor and taken away my disgrace among the people.”

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orge965148">
<p>
<a id="1-26"></a> <b>26</b> In the sixth month, God sent the angel Gabriel to a town in Galilee called Nazareth, 
<a id="1-27"></a> <b>27</b> to a virgin pledged in marriage to a man named Joseph, who was of the house of David. And the virgin&rsquo;s name was Mary. 
<a id="1-28"></a> <b>28</b> The angel appeared to her and said, “Greetings, you who are highly favored! The Lord is with you.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="1-29"></a> <b>29</b> Mary was greatly troubled at his words and wondered what kind of greeting this might be. 
<a id="1-30"></a> <b>30</b> So the angel told her, “Do not be afraid, Mary, for you have found favor with God. 
<a id="1-31"></a> <b>31</b> Behold, you will conceive and give birth to a son, and you are to give Him the name Jesus. 
<a id="1-32"></a> <b>32</b> He will be great and will be called the Son of the Most High. The Lord God will give Him the throne of His father David, 
<a id="1-33"></a> <b>33</b> and He will reign over the house of Jacob forever. His kingdom will never end!”
</p>

<p>
<a id="1-34"></a> <b>34</b> “How can this be,” Mary asked the angel, “since I am a virgin?”
</p>

<p>
<a id="1-35"></a> <b>35</b> The angel replied, “The Holy Spirit will come upon you, and the power of the Most High will overshadow you. So the Holy One to be born will be called the Son of God. 
<a id="1-36"></a> <b>36</b> Look, even Elizabeth your relative has conceived a son in her old age, and she who was called barren is in her sixth month. 
<a id="1-37"></a> <b>37</b> For no word from God will ever fail.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="1-38"></a> <b>38</b> “I am the Lord&rsquo;s servant,” Mary answered. “May it happen to me according to your word.” Then the angel left her.

</p>

<p>
<a id="1-41"></a> <b>41</b> When Elizabeth heard Mary&rsquo;s greeting, the baby leaped in her womb, and Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit. 
<a id="1-42"></a> <b>42</b> In a loud voice she exclaimed, “Blessed are you among women, and blessed is the fruit of your womb! 
<a id="1-43"></a> <b>43</b> And why am I so honored, that the mother of my Lord should come to me? 
<a id="1-44"></a> <b>44</b> For as soon as the sound of your greeting reached my ears, the baby in my womb leaped for joy.

<p>

<a id="1-60"></a> <b>60</b> But his mother replied, “No! He shall be called John.”

<p>
<a id="1-61"></a> <b>61</b> They said to her, “There is no one among your relatives who bears this name.”

<p>
<a id="2-6"></a> <b>6</b> While they were there, the time came for her Child to be born.

<p>
<a id="3-1"></a> In the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius Caesar, while Pontius Pilate was governor of Judea, Herod tetrarch of Galilee, his brother Philip tetrarch of Ituraea and Trachonitis, and Lysanias tetrarch of Abilene, 
<a id="3-2"></a> <b>2</b> during the high priesthood of Annas and Caiaphas, the word of God came to John son of Zechariah in the wilderness.
</p>

<p>
<a id="3-3"></a> <b>3</b> He went into all the region around the Jordan, preaching a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins, 
<a id="3-4"></a> <b>4</b> as it is written in the book of the words of Isaiah the prophet:
</p>

<p>
“A voice of one calling in the wilderness,
</p>

<p>
‘Prepare the way for the Lord,
</p>

<p>
make straight paths for Him.
</p>

<p>
<a id="3-5"></a> <b>5</b> Every valley shall be filled in,
</p>

<p>
and every mountain and hill made low.
</p>

<p>
The crooked ways shall be made straight,
</p>

<p>
and the rough ways smooth.
</p>

<p>
<a id="3-6"></a> <b>6</b> And all humanity will see God&rsquo;s salvation.&rsquo; ”
</p>

<p>
<a id="3-7"></a> <b>7</b> Then John said to the crowds coming out to be baptized by him, “You brood of vipers, who warned you to flee from the coming wrath? 
<a id="3-8"></a> <b>8</b> Produce fruit, then, in keeping with repentance. And do not begin to say to yourselves, ‘We have Abraham as our father.&rsquo; For I tell you that out of these stones God can raise up children for Abraham. 
<a id="3-9"></a> <b>9</b> The axe lies ready at the root of the trees, and every tree that does not produce good fruit will be cut down and thrown into the fire.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="3-10"></a> <b>10</b> The crowds asked him, “What then should we do?”
</p>

<p>
<a id="3-11"></a> <b>11</b> John replied, “Whoever has two tunics should share with him who has none, and whoever has food should do the same.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="3-12"></a> <b>12</b> Even tax collectors came to be baptized. “Teacher,” they asked, “what should we do?”
</p>

<p>
<a id="3-13"></a> <b>13</b> “Collect no more than you are authorized,” he answered.
</p>

<p>
<a id="3-14"></a> <b>14</b> Then some soldiers asked him, “And what should we do?”
</p>

<p>
“Do not take money by force or false accusation,” he said. “Be content with your wages.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="3-15"></a> <b>15</b> The people were waiting expectantly and were all wondering in their hearts if John could be the Christ. 
<a id="3-16"></a> <b>16</b> John answered all of them: “I baptize you with water, but One more powerful than I will come, the straps of whose sandals I am not worthy to untie. He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and with fire. 
<a id="3-17"></a> <b>17</b> His winnowing fork is in His hand to clear His threshing floor and to gather the wheat into His barn; but He will burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="3-18"></a> <b>18</b> With these and many other exhortations, John proclaimed the good news to the people. 
<a id="3-19"></a> <b>19</b> But when he rebuked Herod the tetrarch regarding his brother&rsquo;s wife Herodias and all the evils he had done, 
<a id="3-20"></a> <b>20</b> Herod added this to them all: He locked John up in prison.

<p>
<a id="4-4"></a> <b>4</b> But Jesus answered, “It is written: ‘Man shall not live on bread alone.&rsquo;”

<a id="10-26"></a> <b>26</b> “What is written in the Law?” Jesus replied. “How do you read it?”

<p>
<a id="15-13"></a> <b>13</b> After a few days, the younger son got everything together and journeyed to a distant country, where he squandered his wealth in wild living.

<a id="15-14"></a> <b>14</b> After he had spent all he had, a severe famine swept through that country, and he began to be in need.

<a id="15-16"></a> <b>16</b> He longed to fill his belly with the pods the pigs were eating, but no one would give him a thing.
</p>

<p>
<a id="15-17"></a> <b>17</b> Finally he came to his senses and said, ‘How many of my father&rsquo;s hired servants have plenty of food? But here I am, starving to death! 
<a id="15-18"></a> <b>18</b> I will get up and go back to my father and say to him, “Father, I have sinned against heaven and against you.

</p>

<p>
<a id="15-20"></a> <b>20</b> So he got up and went to his father. But while he was still in the distance, his father saw him and was filled with compassion. He ran to his son, embraced him, and kissed him.

<p>
<a id="15-21"></a> <b>21</b> The son declared, ‘Father, I have sinned against heaven and against you. I am no longer worthy to be called your son.&rsquo;

<p>
<a id="16-5"></a> <b>5</b> And he called in each one of his master&rsquo;s debtors. ‘How much do you owe my master?&rsquo; he asked the first.

<p>
‘Take your bill and write eighty,&rsquo; he told him.

<p>
<a id="16-8"></a> <b>8</b> The master commended the dishonest manager because he had acted shrewdly. For the sons of this age are more shrewd in dealing with their own kind than are the sons of light.

<p>
<a id="23-32"></a> <b>32</b> Two others, who were criminals, were also led away to be executed with Jesus.
</p>

<p>
<a id="23-33"></a> <b>33</b> When they came to the place called The Skull, they crucified Him there, along with the criminals, one on His right and the other on His left.
</p>

<p>
<a id="23-34"></a> <b>34</b> Then Jesus said, “Father, forgive them, for they do not know what they are doing.” And they divided up His garments by casting lots.
</p>

<p>
<a id="23-35"></a> <b>35</b> The people stood watching, and the rulers sneered at Him, saying, “He saved others; let Him save Himself if He is the Christ of God, the Chosen One.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="23-36"></a> <b>36</b> The soldiers also mocked Him and came up to offer Him sour wine.
<a id="23-37"></a> <b>37</b> “If You are the King of the Jews,” they said, “save Yourself!”

<p>
<a id="23-38"></a> <b>38</b> Above Him was posted an inscription:

<p>
<a id="23-39"></a> <b>39</b> One of the criminals who hung there heaped abuse on Him. “Are You not the Christ?” he said. “Save Yourself and us!”
</p>

<p>
<a id="23-40"></a> <b>40</b> But the other one rebuked him, saying, “Do you not even fear God, since you are under the same judgment? 
<a id="23-41"></a> <b>41</b> We are punished justly, for we are receiving what our actions deserve. But this man has done nothing wrong.” 
<a id="23-42"></a> <b>42</b> Then he said, “Jesus, remember me when You come into Your kingdom!”
</p>

<p>
<a id="23-43"></a> <b>43</b> And Jesus said to him, “Truly I tell you, today you will be with Me in Paradise.”

<p>
<a id="23-46"></a> <b>46</b> Then Jesus called out in a loud voice, “Father, into Your hands I commit My Spirit.” And when He had said this, He breathed His last.

<a id="24-8"></a> <b>8</b> Then they remembered His words.

<h3 id="org268eade">The Road to Emmaus (Mark 16:12&#x2013;13)</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org268eade">
<p>
<a id="24-13"></a> <b>13</b> That same day two of them were going to a village called Emmaus, about seven miles from Jerusalem. 
<a id="24-14"></a> <b>14</b> They were talking with each other about everything that had happened. 
<a id="24-15"></a> <b>15</b> And as they talked and deliberated, Jesus Himself came up and walked along with them. 
<a id="24-16"></a> <b>16</b> But their eyes were kept from recognizing Him.
</p>

<p>
<a id="24-17"></a> <b>17</b> He asked them, “What are you discussing so intently as you walk along?”
</p>

<p>
They stood still, with sadness on their faces. 
<a id="24-18"></a> <b>18</b> One of them, named Cleopas, asked Him, “Are You the only visitor to Jerusalem who does not know the things that have happened there in recent days?”
</p>

<p>
<a id="24-19"></a> <b>19</b> “What things?” He asked.
</p>

<p>
“The events involving Jesus of Nazareth,” they answered. “This man was a prophet, powerful in speech and action before God and all the people. 
<a id="24-20"></a> <b>20</b> Our chief priests and rulers delivered Him up to the sentence of death, and they crucified Him. 
<a id="24-21"></a> <b>21</b> But we were hoping He was the One who would redeem Israel. And besides all this, it is the third day since these things took place.
</p>

<p>
<a id="24-22"></a> <b>22</b> Furthermore, some of our women astounded us. They were at the tomb early this morning, 
<a id="24-23"></a> <b>23</b> but they did not find His body. They came and told us they had seen a vision of angels, who said that Jesus was alive. 
<a id="24-24"></a> <b>24</b> Then some of our companions went to the tomb and found it just as the women had described. But Him they did not see.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="24-25"></a> <b>25</b> Then Jesus said to them, “O foolish ones, how slow are your hearts to believe all that the prophets have spoken! 
<a id="24-26"></a> <b>26</b> Was it not necessary for the Christ to suffer these things and then to enter His glory?” 
<a id="24-27"></a> <b>27</b> And beginning with Moses and all the Prophets, He explained to them what was written in all the Scriptures about Himself.
</p>

<p>
<a id="24-28"></a> <b>28</b> As they approached the village where they were headed, He seemed to be going farther. 
<a id="24-29"></a> <b>29</b> But they pleaded with Him, “Stay with us, for it is nearly evening and the day is almost over.”
</p>

<p>
So He went in to stay with them. 
<a id="24-30"></a> <b>30</b> While He was reclining at the table with them, He took bread, spoke a blessing and broke it, and gave it to them. 
<a id="24-31"></a> <b>31</b> Then their eyes were opened and they recognized Jesus&#x2014;and He disappeared from their sight.
</p>

<p>
<a id="24-32"></a> <b>32</b> They asked each other, “Were not our hearts burning within us as He spoke with us on the road and opened the Scriptures to us?” 
<a id="24-33"></a> <b>33</b> And they got up that very hour and returned to Jerusalem.
</p>

<p>
There they found the Eleven and those with them, gathered together 
<a id="24-34"></a> <b>34</b> and saying, “The Lord has indeed risen and has appeared to Simon!”
</p>

<p>
<a id="24-35"></a> <b>35</b> Then the two told what had happened on the road, and how they had recognized Jesus in the breaking of the bread.

<p>
<a id="24-36"></a> <b>36</b> While they were describing these events, Jesus Himself stood among them and said, “Peace be with you.” 
<a id="24-37"></a> <b>37</b> But they were startled and frightened, thinking they had seen a spirit.
</p>

<p>
<a id="24-38"></a> <b>38</b> “Why are you troubled,” Jesus asked, “and why do doubts arise in your hearts? 
<a id="24-39"></a> <b>39</b> Look at My hands and My feet. It is I Myself. Touch Me and see&#x2014;for a spirit does not have flesh and bones, as you see I have.” 
<a id="24-40"></a> <b>40</b> And when He had said this, He showed them His hands and feet.
</p>

<p>
<a id="24-41"></a> <b>41</b> While they were still in disbelief because of their joy and amazement, He asked them, “Do you have anything here to eat?” 
<a id="24-42"></a> <b>42</b> So they gave Him a piece of broiled fish, 
<a id="24-43"></a> <b>43</b> and He took it and ate it in front of them.

<p>
<a id="24-44"></a> <b>44</b> Jesus said to them, “These are the words I spoke to you while I was still with you: Everything must be fulfilled that is written about Me in the Law of Moses, the Prophets, and the Psalms.”

<p>
<a id="24-46"></a> <b>46</b> And He told them, “This is what is written: The Christ will suffer and rise from the dead on the third day,

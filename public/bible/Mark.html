<p>
<a id="1-1"></a> This is the beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of God. 
<a id="1-2"></a> <b>2</b> As it is written in Isaiah the prophet:
</p>

<p>
“Behold, I will send My messenger ahead of You,
</p>

<p>
who will prepare Your way.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="1-3"></a> <b>3</b> “A voice of one calling in the wilderness,
</p>

<p>
‘Prepare the way for the Lord,
</p>

<p>
make straight paths for Him.&rsquo; ”
</p>

<p>
<a id="1-4"></a> <b>4</b> John the Baptist appeared in the wilderness, preaching a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins. 
<a id="1-5"></a> <b>5</b> People went out to him from all of Jerusalem and the countryside of Judea. Confessing their sins, they were baptized by him in the Jordan River.
</p>

<p>
<a id="1-6"></a> <b>6</b> John was clothed in camel&rsquo;s hair, with a leather belt around his waist. His food was locusts and wild honey. 
<a id="1-7"></a> <b>7</b> And he began to proclaim: “After me will come One more powerful than I, the straps of whose sandals I am not worthy to stoop down and untie. 
<a id="1-8"></a> <b>8</b> I baptize you with water, but He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="1-9"></a> <b>9</b> In those days Jesus came from Nazareth in Galilee and was baptized by John in the Jordan. 
<a id="1-10"></a> <b>10</b> As soon as Jesus came up out of the water, He saw the heavens breaking open and the Spirit descending on Him like a dove. 
<a id="1-11"></a> <b>11</b> And a voice came from heaven: “You are My beloved Son; in You I am well pleased.”

<p>
<a id="1-12"></a> <b>12</b> At once the Spirit drove Jesus into the wilderness, 
<a id="1-13"></a> <b>13</b> and He was there for forty days, being tempted by Satan. He was with the wild animals, and the angels ministered to Him.
</p>

<p>
<a id="1-14"></a> <b>14</b> After the arrest of John, Jesus went into Galilee and proclaimed the gospel of God.
<a id="1-15"></a> <b>15</b> “The time is fulfilled,” He said, “and the kingdom of God is near. Repent and believe in the gospel!”

<a id="1-16"></a> <b>16</b> As Jesus was walking beside the Sea of Galilee, He saw Simon and his brother Andrew. They were casting a net into the sea, for they were fishermen.
<a id="1-17"></a> <b>17</b> “Come, follow Me,” Jesus said, “and I will make you fishers of men.” 
<a id="1-18"></a> <b>18</b> And at once they left their nets and followed Him.
</p>

<p>
<a id="1-19"></a> <b>19</b> Going on a little farther, He saw James son of Zebedee and his brother John. They were in a boat, mending their nets. 
<a id="1-20"></a> <b>20</b> Immediately Jesus called them, and they left their father Zebedee in the boat with the hired men and followed Him.

<a id="1-21"></a> <b>21</b> Then Jesus and His companions went to Capernaum, and right away Jesus entered the synagogue on the Sabbath and began to teach. 
<a id="1-22"></a> <b>22</b> The people were astonished at His teaching, because He taught as one who had authority, and not as the scribes.
</p>

<p>
<a id="1-23"></a> <b>23</b> Suddenly a man with an unclean spirit cried out in the synagogue:
<a id="1-24"></a> <b>24</b> “What do You want with us, Jesus of Nazareth? Have You come to destroy us? I know who You are&#x2014;the Holy One of God!”
</p>

<p>
<a id="1-25"></a> <b>25</b> But Jesus rebuked the spirit. “Be silent!” He said. “Come out of him!” 
<a id="1-26"></a> <b>26</b> At this, the unclean spirit threw the man into convulsions and came out with a loud shriek.
</p>

<p>
<a id="1-27"></a> <b>27</b> All the people were amazed and began to ask one another, “What is this? A new teaching with authority! He commands even the unclean spirits, and they obey Him!” 
<a id="1-28"></a> <b>28</b> And the news about Jesus spread quickly through the whole region of Galilee.

<p>
<a id="1-29"></a> <b>29</b> As soon as Jesus and His companions had left the synagogue, they went with James and John to the home of Simon and Andrew. 
<a id="1-30"></a> <b>30</b> Simon&rsquo;s mother-in-law was sick in bed with a fever, and they promptly told Jesus about her. 
<a id="1-31"></a> <b>31</b> So He went to her, took her by the hand, and helped her up. The fever left her, and she began to serve them.
</p>

<p>
<a id="1-32"></a> <b>32</b> That evening, after sunset, people brought to Jesus all who were sick and demon-possessed, 
<a id="1-33"></a> <b>33</b> and the whole town gathered at the door. 
<a id="1-34"></a> <b>34</b> And He healed many who were ill with various diseases and drove out many demons. But He would not allow the demons to speak, because they knew who He was.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgaa35bbc">
<p>
<a id="1-35"></a> <b>35</b> Early in the morning, while it was still dark, Jesus got up and slipped out to a solitary place to pray. 
<a id="1-36"></a> <b>36</b> Simon and his companions went to look for Him, 
<a id="1-37"></a> <b>37</b> and when they found Him, they said, “Everyone is looking for You!”
</p>

<p>
<a id="1-38"></a> <b>38</b> But Jesus answered, “Let us go on to the neighboring towns so I can preach there as well, for that is why I have come.” 
<a id="1-39"></a> <b>39</b> So He went throughout Galilee, preaching in their synagogues and driving out demons.

<p>
<a id="1-40"></a> <b>40</b> Then a leper came to Jesus, begging on his knees: “If You are willing, You can make me clean.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="1-41"></a> <b>41</b> Moved with compassion, Jesus reached out His hand and touched the man. “I am willing,” He said. “Be clean!” 
<a id="1-42"></a> <b>42</b> And immediately the leprosy left him, and the man was cleansed.
</p>

<p>
<a id="1-43"></a> <b>43</b> Jesus promptly sent him away with a stern warning:
<a id="1-44"></a> <b>44</b> “See that you don&rsquo;t tell anyone. But go, show yourself to the priest and present the offering Moses prescribed for your cleansing, as a testimony to them.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="1-45"></a> <b>45</b> But the man went out and openly began to proclaim and spread the news.

Consequently, Jesus could no longer enter a town in plain view, but He stayed out in solitary places. Yet people came to Him from every quarter.

</p>

<p>
<a id="2-3"></a> <b>3</b> Then a paralytic was brought to Him, carried by four men. 
<a id="2-4"></a> <b>4</b> Since they were unable to get to Jesus through the crowd, they uncovered the roof above Him, made an opening, and lowered the paralytic on his mat.
</p>

<p>
<a id="2-5"></a> <b>5</b> When Jesus saw their faith, He said to the paralytic, “Son, your sins are forgiven.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="2-6"></a> <b>6</b> But some of the scribes were sitting there and thinking in their hearts,
<a id="2-7"></a> <b>7</b> “Why does this man speak like this? He is blaspheming! Who can forgive sins but God alone?”
</p>

<p>
<a id="2-8"></a> <b>8</b> At once Jesus knew in His spirit that they were thinking this way within themselves. “Why are you thinking these things in your hearts?” He asked.
<a id="2-9"></a> <b>9</b> “Which is easier: to say to a paralytic, ‘Your sins are forgiven,&rsquo; or to say, ‘Get up, pick up your mat, and walk&rsquo;? 
<a id="2-10"></a> <b>10</b> But so that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins&#x2026;” He said to the paralytic,

</p>

<p>
<a id="2-12"></a> <b>12</b> And immediately the man got up, picked up his mat, and walked out in front of them all. As a result, they were all astounded and glorified God, saying, “We have never seen anything like this!”

<p>
<a id="2-15"></a> <b>15</b> While Jesus was dining at Levi&rsquo;s house, many tax collectors and sinners were eating with Him and His disciples&#x2014;for there were many who followed Him. 
<a id="2-16"></a> <b>16</b> When the scribes who were Pharisees saw Jesus eating with these people, they asked His disciples, “Why does He eat with tax collectors and sinners?”

<a id="5-4"></a> <b>4</b> Though he was often bound with chains and shackles, he had broken the chains and shattered the shackles. Now there was no one with the strength to subdue him.

<p>
<a id="5-11"></a> <b>11</b> There on the nearby hillside a large herd of pigs was feeding.

<p>
<a id="5-13"></a> <b>13</b> He gave them permission, and the unclean spirits came out and went into the pigs, and the herd of about two thousand rushed down the steep bank into the sea and drowned in the water.

<p>
<a id="5-14"></a> <b>14</b> Those tending the pigs ran off and reported this in the town and countryside, and the people went out to see what had happened.

<a id="5-21"></a> <b>21</b> When Jesus had again crossed by boat to the other side, a large crowd gathered around Him beside the sea. 
<a id="5-22"></a> <b>22</b> A synagogue leader named Jairus arrived, and seeing Jesus, he fell at His feet 
<a id="5-23"></a> <b>23</b> and pleaded with Him urgently, “My little daughter is near death. Please come and place Your hands on her, so that she will be healed and live.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="5-24"></a> <b>24</b> So Jesus went with him, and a large crowd followed and pressed around Him. 
<a id="5-25"></a> <b>25</b> And a woman was there who had suffered from bleeding for twelve years. 
<a id="5-26"></a> <b>26</b> She had borne much agony under the care of many physicians and had spent all she had, but to no avail. Instead, her condition had only grown worse.

<p>
<a id="5-30"></a> <b>30</b> At once Jesus was aware that power had gone out from Him. Turning to the crowd, He asked, “Who touched My garments?”
</p>

<p>
<a id="5-31"></a> <b>31</b> His disciples answered, “You can see the crowd pressing in on You, and yet You ask, ‘Who touched Me?&rsquo;”

<a id="5-32"></a> <b>32</b> But He kept looking around to see who had done this.

</p>

<p>
<a id="5-34"></a> <b>34</b> “Daughter,” said Jesus, “your faith has healed you. Go in peace and be free of your affliction.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="5-35"></a> <b>35</b> While He was still speaking, messengers from the house of Jairus arrived and said, “Your daughter is dead; why bother the Teacher anymore?”
</p>

<p>
<a id="5-36"></a> <b>36</b> But Jesus overheard their conversation and said to Jairus, “Do not be afraid; just believe.” 
<a id="5-37"></a> <b>37</b> And He did not allow anyone to accompany Him except Peter, James, and John the brother of James.
</p>

<p>
<a id="5-38"></a> <b>38</b> When they arrived at the house of the synagogue leader, Jesus saw the commotion and the people weeping and wailing loudly. 
<a id="5-39"></a> <b>39</b> He went inside and asked, “Why all this commotion and weeping? The child is not dead, but asleep.” 
<a id="5-40"></a> <b>40</b> And they laughed at Him.

<p>
After He had put them all outside, He took the child&rsquo;s father and mother and His own companions, and went in to see the child. 
<a id="5-41"></a> <b>41</b> Taking her by the hand, Jesus said, “Talitha koum!” which means, “Little girl, I say to you, get up!” 
<a id="5-42"></a> <b>42</b> Immediately the girl got up and began to walk around. She was twelve years old, and at once they were utterly astounded.

<a id="7-1"></a> Then the Pharisees and some of the scribes who had come from Jerusalem gathered around Jesus, 
<a id="7-2"></a> <b>2</b> and they saw some of His disciples eating with hands that were defiled&#x2014;that is, unwashed.
</p>

<p>
<a id="7-3"></a> <b>3</b> Now in holding to the tradition of the elders, the Pharisees and all the Jews do not eat until they wash their hands ceremonially. 
<a id="7-4"></a> <b>4</b> And on returning from the market, they do not eat unless they wash. And there are many other traditions for them to observe, including the washing of cups, pitchers, kettles, and couches for dining.

<p>
<a id="7-5"></a> <b>5</b> So the Pharisees and scribes questioned Jesus: “Why do Your disciples not walk according to the tradition of the elders? Instead, they eat with defiled hands.”

<p>
<a id="7-6"></a> <b>6</b> Jesus answered them, “Isaiah prophesied correctly about you hypocrites, as it is written:

</p>

<p>
<a id="7-7"></a> <b>7</b> They worship Me in vain;

they teach as doctrine the precepts of men.&rsquo;

<p>
<a id="7-8"></a> <b>8</b> You have disregarded the commandment of God to keep the tradition of men.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="7-9"></a> <b>9</b> He went on to say, “You neatly set aside the command of God to maintain your own tradition. 
<a id="7-10"></a> <b>10</b> For Moses said, ‘Honor your father and your mother&rsquo; and ‘Anyone who curses his father or mother must be put to death.&rsquo; 
<a id="7-11"></a> <b>11</b> But you say that if a man says to his father or mother, ‘Whatever you would have received from me is Corban&rsquo; (that is, a gift devoted to God),

<a id="14-54"></a> <b>54</b> Peter followed Him at a distance, right into the courtyard of the high priest. And he sat with the officers and warmed himself by the fire.
</p>

<p>
<a id="14-55"></a> <b>55</b> Now the chief priests and the whole Sanhedrin were seeking testimony against Jesus to put Him to death, but they did not find any. 
<a id="14-56"></a> <b>56</b> For many bore false witness against Jesus, but their testimony was inconsistent.
</p>

<p>
<a id="14-57"></a> <b>57</b> Then some men stood up and testified falsely against Him:
<a id="14-58"></a> <b>58</b> “We heard Him say, ‘I will destroy this man-made temple, and in three days I will build another that is made without hands.&rsquo; ” 
<a id="14-59"></a> <b>59</b> But even their testimony was inconsistent.
</p>

<p>
<a id="14-60"></a> <b>60</b> So the high priest stood up before them and questioned Jesus, “Have You no answer? What are these men testifying against You?”
</p>

<p>
<a id="14-61"></a> <b>61</b> But Jesus remained silent and made no reply.
</p>

<p>
Again the high priest questioned Him, “Are You the Christ, the Son of the Blessed One?”
</p>

<p>
<a id="14-62"></a> <b>62</b> “I am,” said Jesus, “and you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of Power and coming with the clouds of heaven.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="14-63"></a> <b>63</b> At this, the high priest tore his clothes and declared, “Why do we need any more witnesses? 
<a id="14-64"></a> <b>64</b> You have heard the blasphemy. What is your verdict?”
</p>

<p>
And they all condemned Him as deserving of death.
</p>

<p>
<a id="14-65"></a> <b>65</b> Then some of them began to spit on Him. They blindfolded Him, struck Him with their fists, and said to Him, “Prophesy!” And the officers received Him with slaps in His face.

<p>
<a id="14-68"></a> <b>68</b> But he denied it. “I do not know or even understand what you are talking about,” he said. Then he went out to the gateway, and the rooster crowed.
</p>

<p>
<a id="14-69"></a> <b>69</b> There the servant girl saw him and again said to those standing nearby, “This man is one of them.”

<p>
<a id="14-70"></a> <b>70</b> But he denied it again.

After a little while, those standing nearby said once more to Peter, “Surely you are one of them, for you too are a Galilean.”

<p>
<a id="14-71"></a> <b>71</b> But he began to curse and swear, “I do not know this man of whom you speak!”

Then Peter remembered the word that Jesus had spoken to him: “Before the rooster crows twice, you will deny Me three times.” And he broke down and wept.

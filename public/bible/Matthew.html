<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org89bff48">
<p>
<a id="1-18"></a> <b>18</b> This is how the birth of Jesus Christ came about: His mother Mary was pledged in marriage to Joseph, but before they came together, she was found to be with child through the Holy Spirit. 
<a id="1-19"></a> <b>19</b> Because Joseph her husband was a righteous man and was unwilling to disgrace her publicly, he resolved to divorce her quietly.
</p>

<p>
<a id="1-20"></a> <b>20</b> But after he had pondered these things, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream and said, “Joseph, son of David, do not be afraid to embrace Mary as your wife, for the One conceived in her is from the Holy Spirit. 
<a id="1-21"></a> <b>21</b> She will give birth to a Son, and you are to give Him the name Jesus, because He will save His people from their sins.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="1-22"></a> <b>22</b> All this took place to fulfill what the Lord had said through the prophet:
</p>

<p>
<a id="1-23"></a> <b>23</b> “Behold, the virgin will be with child
</p>

<p>
and will give birth to a son,

and they will call Him Immanuel”

<p>
(which means, “God with us”).

<p>
<a id="1-24"></a> <b>24</b> When Joseph woke up, he did as the angel of the Lord had commanded him, and embraced Mary as his wife. 
<a id="1-25"></a> <b>25</b> But he had no union with her until she gave birth to a Son. And he gave Him the name Jesus.

<a id="2-1"></a> After Jesus was born in Bethlehem in Judea, during the time of King Herod, Magi from the east arrived in Jerusalem, 
<a id="2-2"></a> <b>2</b> asking, “Where is the One who has been born King of the Jews? We saw His star in the east and have come to worship Him.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="2-3"></a> <b>3</b> When King Herod heard this, he was disturbed, and all Jerusalem with him. 
<a id="2-4"></a> <b>4</b> And when he had assembled all the chief priests and scribes of the people, he asked them where the Christ was to be born.
</p>

<p>
<a id="2-5"></a> <b>5</b> “In Bethlehem in Judea,” they replied, “for this is what the prophet has written:
</p>

<p>
<a id="2-6"></a> <b>6</b> ‘But you, Bethlehem, in the land of Judah,
</p>

<p>
are by no means least among the rulers of Judah,

for out of you will come a ruler
</p>

<p>
who will be the shepherd of My people Israel.&rsquo;”
</p>

<p>
<a id="2-7"></a> <b>7</b> Then Herod called the Magi secretly and learned from them the exact time the star had appeared. 
<a id="2-8"></a> <b>8</b> And sending them to Bethlehem, he said: “Go and search carefully for the Child, and when you find Him, report to me, so that I too may go and worship Him.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="2-9"></a> <b>9</b> After they had heard the king, they went on their way, and the star they had seen in the east went ahead of them until it stood over the place where the Child was. 
<a id="2-10"></a> <b>10</b> When they saw the star, they rejoiced with great delight. 
<a id="2-11"></a> <b>11</b> On coming to the house, they saw the Child with His mother Mary, and they fell down and worshiped Him. Then they opened their treasures and presented Him with gifts of gold and frankincense and myrrh.
</p>

<p>
<a id="2-12"></a> <b>12</b> And having been warned in a dream not to return to Herod, they withdrew to their country by another route.

<p>
<a id="2-14"></a> <b>14</b> So he got up, took the Child and His mother by night, and withdrew to Egypt,

<a id="2-17"></a> <b>17</b> Then what was spoken through the prophet Jeremiah was fulfilled:

<a id="3-8"></a> <b>8</b> Produce fruit, then, in keeping with repentance. 
<a id="3-9"></a> <b>9</b> And do not presume to say to yourselves, ‘We have Abraham as our father.&rsquo; For I tell you that out of these stones God can raise up children for Abraham.

<p>
<a id="28-1"></a> After the Sabbath, at dawn on the first day of the week, Mary Magdalene and the other Mary went to see the tomb.
</p>

<p>
<a id="28-2"></a> <b>2</b> Suddenly there was a great earthquake, for an angel of the Lord descended from heaven, rolled away the stone, and sat on it. 
<a id="28-3"></a> <b>3</b> His appearance was like lightning, and his clothes were white as snow. 
<a id="28-4"></a> <b>4</b> The guards trembled in fear of him and became like dead men.
</p>

<p>
<a id="28-5"></a> <b>5</b> But the angel said to the women, “Do not be afraid, for I know that you are looking for Jesus, who was crucified. 
<a id="28-6"></a> <b>6</b> He is not here; He has risen, just as He said! Come, see the place where He lay. 
<a id="28-7"></a> <b>7</b> Then go quickly and tell His disciples, ‘He has risen from the dead and is going ahead of you into Galilee. There you will see Him.&rsquo; See, I have told you.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="28-8"></a> <b>8</b> So they hurried away from the tomb in fear and great joy, and ran to tell His disciples. 
<a id="28-9"></a> <b>9</b> Suddenly Jesus met them and said, “Greetings!” They came to Him, grasped His feet, and worshiped Him.
<a id="28-10"></a> <b>10</b> “Do not be afraid,” said Jesus. “Go and tell My brothers to go to Galilee. There they will see Me.”

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org4ddfd09">
<p>
<a id="28-11"></a> <b>11</b> While the women were on their way, some of the guards went into the city and reported to the chief priests all that had happened. 
<a id="28-12"></a> <b>12</b> And after the chief priests had met with the elders and formed a plan, they gave the soldiers a large sum of money 
<a id="28-13"></a> <b>13</b> and instructed them: “You are to say, ‘His disciples came by night and stole Him away while we were asleep.&rsquo; 
<a id="28-14"></a> <b>14</b> If this report reaches the governor, we will satisfy him and keep you out of trouble.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="28-15"></a> <b>15</b> So the guards took the money and did as they were instructed. And this account has been circulated among the Jews to this very day.

<p>
<a id="28-18"></a> <b>18</b> Then Jesus came to them and said, “All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to Me.

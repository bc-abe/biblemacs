<p>
<a id="1-1"></a> This is the word of the LORD that came to Micah the Moreshite in the days of Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah&#x2014;what he saw regarding Samaria and Jerusalem:
</p>

<p>
<a id="1-2"></a> <b>2</b> Hear, O peoples, all of you;
</p>

<p>
listen, O earth, and everyone in it!
</p>

<p>
May the Lord GOD bear witness against you,
</p>

<p>
the Lord from His holy temple.
</p>

<p>
<a id="1-3"></a> <b>3</b> For behold, the LORD comes forth
</p>

<p>
from His dwelling place;
</p>

<p>
He will come down and tread
</p>

<p>
on the high places of the earth.
</p>

<p>
<a id="1-4"></a> <b>4</b> The mountains will melt beneath Him,
</p>

<p>
and the valleys will split apart,
</p>

<p>
like wax before the fire,
</p>

<p>
like water rushing down a slope.
</p>

<p>
<a id="1-5"></a> <b>5</b> All this is for the transgression of Jacob
</p>

<p>
and the sins of the house of Israel.
</p>

<p>
What is the transgression of Jacob?
</p>

<p>
Is it not Samaria?
</p>

<p>
And what is the high place of Judah?
</p>

<p>
Is it not Jerusalem?
</p>

<p>
<a id="1-6"></a> <b>6</b> Therefore I will make Samaria
</p>

<p>
a heap of rubble in the open field,
</p>

<p>
a planting area for a vineyard.
</p>

<p>
I will pour her stones into the valley
</p>

<p>
and expose her foundations.
</p>

<p>
<a id="1-7"></a> <b>7</b> All her carved images will be smashed to pieces;
</p>

<p>
all her wages will be burned in the fire,
</p>

<p>
and I will destroy all her idols.
</p>

<p>
Since she collected the wages of a prostitute,
</p>

<p>
they will be used again on a prostitute.
</p>

<p>
Weeping and Mourning
</p>

<p>
<a id="1-8"></a> <b>8</b> Because of this I will lament and wail;
</p>

<p>
I will walk barefoot and naked.
</p>

<p>
I will howl like a jackal
</p>

<p>
and mourn like an ostrich.
</p>

<p>
<a id="1-9"></a> <b>9</b> For her wound is incurable;
</p>

<p>
it has reached even Judah;
</p>

<p>
it has approached the gate of my people,
</p>

<p>
as far as Jerusalem itself.
</p>

<p>
<a id="1-10"></a> <b>10</b> Do not tell it in Gath; do not weep at all.
</p>

<p>
Roll in the dust in Beth-leaphrah.
</p>

<p>
<a id="1-11"></a> <b>11</b> Depart in shameful nakedness,
</p>

<p>
O dwellers of Shaphir.
</p>

<p>
The dwellers of Zaanan
</p>

<p>
will not come out.
</p>

<p>
Beth-ezel is in mourning;
</p>

<p>
its support is taken from you.
</p>

<p>
<a id="1-12"></a> <b>12</b> For the dwellers of Maroth pined for good,
</p>

<p>
but calamity came down from the LORD,
</p>

<p>
even to the gate of Jerusalem.
</p>

<p>
<a id="1-13"></a> <b>13</b> Harness your chariot horses,
</p>

<p>
O dweller of Lachish.
</p>

<p>
You were the beginning of sin to the Daughter of Zion,
</p>

<p>
for the transgressions of Israel were found in you.
</p>

<p>
<a id="1-14"></a> <b>14</b> Therefore, send farewell gifts to Moresheth-gath;
</p>

<p>
the houses of Achzib will prove deceptive
</p>

<p>
to the kings of Israel.
</p>

<p>
<a id="1-15"></a> <b>15</b> I will again bring a conqueror against you,
</p>

<p>
O dweller of Mareshah.
</p>

<p>
The glory of Israel will come to Adullam.
</p>

<p>
<a id="1-16"></a> <b>16</b> Shave yourselves bald and cut off your hair
</p>

<p>
in mourning for your precious children;
</p>

<p>
make yourselves as bald as an eagle,
</p>

<p>
for they will go from you into exile.

At that time He will hide His face from them

because of the evil they have done.

<p>
<a id="3-5"></a> <b>5</b> This is what the LORD says:

<p>
<a id="1-1"></a> This is the burden against Nineveh, the book of the vision of Nahum the Elkoshite:
</p>

<p>
<a id="1-2"></a> <b>2</b> The LORD is a jealous and avenging God;
</p>

<p>
the LORD is avenging and full of wrath.
</p>

<p>
The LORD takes vengeance on His foes
</p>

<p>
and reserves wrath for His enemies.
</p>

<p>
<a id="1-3"></a> <b>3</b> The LORD is slow to anger
</p>

<p>
and great in power;
</p>

<p>
the LORD will by no means
</p>

<p>
leave the guilty unpunished.
</p>

<p>
His path is in the whirlwind and storm,
</p>

<p>
and clouds are the dust beneath His feet.
</p>

<p>
<a id="1-4"></a> <b>4</b> He rebukes the sea and dries it up;
</p>

<p>
He makes all the rivers run dry.
</p>

<p>
Bashan and Carmel wither,
</p>

<p>
and the flower of Lebanon wilts.
</p>

<p>
<a id="1-5"></a> <b>5</b> The mountains quake before Him,
</p>

<p>
and the hills melt away;
</p>

<p>
the earth trembles at His presence&#x2014;
</p>

<p>
the world and all its dwellers.
</p>

<p>
<a id="1-6"></a> <b>6</b> Who can withstand His indignation?
</p>

<p>
Who can endure His burning anger?
</p>

<p>
His wrath is poured out like fire;
</p>

<p>
even rocks are shattered before Him.
</p>

<p>
<a id="1-7"></a> <b>7</b> The LORD is good,
</p>

<p>
a stronghold in the day of distress;
</p>

<p>
He cares for those who trust in Him.
</p>

<p>
<a id="1-8"></a> <b>8</b> But with an overwhelming flood
</p>

<p>
He will make an end of Nineveh
</p>

<p>
and pursue His enemies into darkness.
</p>

<p>
<a id="1-9"></a> <b>9</b> Whatever you plot against the LORD,
</p>

<p>
He will bring to an end.
</p>

<p>
Affliction will not rise up
</p>

<p>
a second time.
</p>

<p>
<a id="1-10"></a> <b>10</b> For they will be entangled as with thorns
</p>

<p>
and consumed like the drink of a drunkard&#x2014;
</p>

<p>
like stubble that is fully dry.
</p>

<p>
<a id="1-11"></a> <b>11</b> From you, O Nineveh, comes forth
</p>

<p>
a plotter of evil against the LORD,
</p>

<p>
a counselor of wickedness.
</p>

<p>
<a id="1-12"></a> <b>12</b> This is what the LORD says:
</p>

<p>
“Though they are allied and numerous,
</p>

<p>
yet they will be cut down and pass away.
</p>

<p>
Though I have afflicted you, O Judah,
</p>

<p>
I will afflict you no longer.
</p>

<p>
<a id="1-13"></a> <b>13</b> For I will now break their yoke from your neck
</p>

<p>
and tear away your shackles.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="1-14"></a> <b>14</b> The LORD has issued a command concerning you, O Nineveh:
</p>

<p>
“There will be no descendants
</p>

<p>
to carry on your name.
</p>

<p>
I will cut off the carved image and cast idol
</p>

<p>
from the house of your gods;
</p>

<p>
I will prepare your grave,
</p>

<p>
for you are contemptible.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="1-15"></a> <b>15</b> Look to the mountains&#x2014;
</p>

<p>
the feet of one who brings good news,
</p>

<p>
who proclaims peace!
</p>

<p>
Celebrate your feasts, O Judah;
</p>

<p>
fulfill your vows.
</p>

<p>
For the wicked will never again march through you;
</p>

<p>
they will be utterly cut off.

Summon all your strength!

<p>
though destroyers have laid them waste
</p>

<p>
and ruined the branches of their vine.

<p>
<a id="2-3"></a> <b>3</b> The shields of his mighty men are red;

the valiant warriors are dressed in scarlet.

The fittings of the chariots flash like fire

on the day they are prepared,

They race to its wall;

the protective shield is set in place.

<a id="2-8"></a> <b>8</b> Nineveh has been like a pool of water

<p>
throughout her days,
</p>

<p>
but now it is draining away.
</p>

<p>
“Stop! Stop!” they cry,

but no one turns back.

<p>
<a id="2-9"></a> <b>9</b> “Plunder the silver!

where the lion and lioness prowled with their cubs,

with nothing to frighten them away?

It filled its dens with the kill,

<p>
<a id="1-1"></a> These are the words of Nehemiah son of Hacaliah:
</p>

<p>
In the month of Chislev, in the twentieth year, while I was in the citadel of Susa, 
<a id="1-2"></a> <b>2</b> Hanani, one of my brothers, arrived with men from Judah. So I questioned them about the remnant of the Jews who had survived the exile, and also about Jerusalem.
</p>

<p>
<a id="1-3"></a> <b>3</b> And they told me, “The remnant who survived the exile are there in the province, in great trouble and disgrace. The wall of Jerusalem is broken down, and its gates are burned with fire.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="1-4"></a> <b>4</b> When I heard these words, I sat down and wept. I mourned for days, fasting and praying before the God of heaven.
</p>

<p>
<a id="1-5"></a> <b>5</b> Then I said:
</p>

<p>
“O LORD, God of heaven, the great and awesome God who keeps His covenant of loving devotion with those who love Him and keep His commandments, 
<a id="1-6"></a> <b>6</b> let Your eyes be open and Your ears attentive to hear the prayer that I, Your servant, now pray before You day and night for Your servants, the Israelites.
</p>

<p>
I confess the sins that we Israelites have committed against You. Both I and my father&rsquo;s house have sinned. 
<a id="1-7"></a> <b>7</b> We have behaved corruptly against You and have not kept the commandments, statutes, and ordinances that You gave Your servant Moses.
</p>

<p>
<a id="1-8"></a> <b>8</b> Remember, I pray, the word that You commanded Your servant Moses when You said, ‘If you are unfaithful, I will scatter you among the nations, 
<a id="1-9"></a> <b>9</b> but if you return to Me and keep and practice My commandments, then even if your exiles have been banished to the farthest horizon, I will gather them from there and bring them to the place I have chosen as a dwelling for My Name.&rsquo;
</p>

<p>
<a id="1-10"></a> <b>10</b> They are Your servants and Your people. You redeemed them by Your great power and mighty hand. 
<a id="1-11"></a> <b>11</b> O Lord, may Your ear be attentive to my prayer and to the prayers of Your servants who delight to revere Your name. Give Your servant success this day, I pray, and grant him mercy in the sight of this man.”
</p>

<p>
(At that time I was the cupbearer to the king.)

<p>
<a id="2-1"></a> Now in the month of Nisan, in the twentieth year of King Artaxerxes, when wine was set before him, I took the wine and gave it to the king. I had never been sad in his presence, 
<a id="2-2"></a> <b>2</b> so the king said to me, “Why is your face sad, though you are not ill? This could only be sadness of the heart.”
</p>

<p>
I was overwhelmed with fear 
<a id="2-3"></a> <b>3</b> and replied to the king, “May the king live forever! Why should I not be sad when the city where my fathers are buried lies in ruins, and its gates have been destroyed by fire?”
</p>

<p>
<a id="2-4"></a> <b>4</b> “What is your request?” replied the king.
</p>

<p>
So I prayed to the God of heaven 
<a id="2-5"></a> <b>5</b> and answered the king, “If it pleases the king, and if your servant has found favor in your sight, I ask that you send me to Judah, to the city where my fathers are buried, so that I may rebuild it.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="2-6"></a> <b>6</b> Then the king, with the queen seated beside him, asked me, “How long will your journey take, and when will you return?” So it pleased the king to send me, and I set a time.
</p>

<p>
<a id="2-7"></a> <b>7</b> I also said to him, “If it pleases the king, may letters be given to me for the governors west of the Euphrates, so that they will grant me safe passage until I reach Judah. 
<a id="2-8"></a> <b>8</b> And may I have a letter to Asaph, keeper of the king&rsquo;s forest, so that he will give me timber to make beams for the gates of the citadel to the temple, for the city wall, and for the house I will occupy.”
</p>

<p>
And because the gracious hand of my God was upon me, the king granted my requests.
</p>

<p>
<a id="2-9"></a> <b>9</b> Then I went to the governors west of the Euphrates and gave them the king&rsquo;s letters. The king had also sent army officers and cavalry with me.
</p>

<p>
<a id="2-10"></a> <b>10</b> But when Sanballat the Horonite and Tobiah the Ammonite official heard about this, they were deeply disturbed that someone had come to seek the well-being of the Israelites.

<h3 id="org8e3e101">Nehemiah Inspects the Walls</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org8e3e101">
<p>
<a id="2-11"></a> <b>11</b> After I had arrived in Jerusalem and had been there three days, 
<a id="2-12"></a> <b>12</b> I set out at night with a few men. I did not tell anyone what my God had laid on my heart to do for Jerusalem. The only animal with me was the one on which I was riding.
</p>

<p>
<a id="2-13"></a> <b>13</b> So I went out at night through the Valley Gate toward the Well of the Serpent and the Dung Gate, and I inspected the walls of Jerusalem that had been broken down and the gates that had been destroyed by fire.
</p>

<p>
<a id="2-14"></a> <b>14</b> Then I went on to the Fountain Gate and the King&rsquo;s Pool, but there was no room for the animal under me to get through; 
<a id="2-15"></a> <b>15</b> so I went up the valley by night and inspected the wall. Then I headed back and reentered through the Valley Gate.
</p>

<p>
<a id="2-16"></a> <b>16</b> The officials did not know where I had gone or what I was doing, for I had not yet told the Jews or priests or nobles or officials or any other workers. 
<a id="2-17"></a> <b>17</b> Then I said to them, “You see the trouble we are in. Jerusalem lies in ruins, and its gates have been burned down. Come, let us rebuild the wall of Jerusalem, so that we will no longer be a disgrace.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="2-18"></a> <b>18</b> I also told them about the gracious hand of my God upon me, and what the king had said to me.
</p>

<p>
“Let us start rebuilding,” they replied, and they set their hands to this good work.
</p>

<p>
<a id="2-19"></a> <b>19</b> But when Sanballat the Horonite, Tobiah the Ammonite official, and Geshem the Arab heard about this, they mocked us and ridiculed us, saying, “What is this you are doing? Are you rebelling against the king?”
</p>

<p>
<a id="2-20"></a> <b>20</b> So I answered them and said, “The God of heaven is the One who will grant us success. We, His servants, will start rebuilding, but you have no portion, right, or claim in Jerusalem.”

<p>

He also repaired the wall of the Pool of Shelah near the king&rsquo;s garden, as far as the stairs that descend from the City of David.
</p>

<p>
<a id="3-16"></a> <b>16</b> Beyond him, Nehemiah son of Azbuk, ruler of a half-district of Beth-zur, made repairs up to a point opposite the tombs of David, as far as the artificial pool and the House of the Mighty.
</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>
<a id="4-1"></a> Now when Sanballat heard that we were rebuilding the wall, he was furious and filled with indignation. He ridiculed the Jews 
<a id="4-2"></a> <b>2</b> before his associates and the army of Samaria, saying, “What are these feeble Jews doing? Can they restore the wall by themselves? Will they offer sacrifices? Will they complete it in a day? Can they bring these burnt stones back to life from the mounds of rubble?”
</p>

<p>
<a id="4-3"></a> <b>3</b> Then Tobiah the Ammonite, who was beside him, said, “If even a fox were to climb up on what they are building, it would break down their wall of stones!”
</p>

<p>
<a id="4-4"></a> <b>4</b> Hear us, O God, for we are despised. Turn their scorn back upon their own heads, and let them be taken as plunder to a land of captivity. 
<a id="4-5"></a> <b>5</b> Do not cover up their iniquity or let their sin be blotted out from Your sight, for they have provoked the builders.
</p>

<p>
<a id="4-6"></a> <b>6</b> So we rebuilt the wall until all of it was joined together up to half its height, for the people had a mind to work.
</p>

<p>
<a id="4-7"></a> <b>7</b> When Sanballat and Tobiah, together with the Arabs, Ammonites, and Ashdodites, heard that the repair to the walls of Jerusalem was progressing and that the gaps were being closed, they were furious, 
<a id="4-8"></a> <b>8</b> and all of them conspired to come and fight against Jerusalem and create a hindrance.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-orgb36bb1f" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orgb36bb1f">Discouragement Overcome</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgb36bb1f">
<p>
<a id="4-9"></a> <b>9</b> So we prayed to our God and posted a guard against them day and night.
</p>

<p>
<a id="4-10"></a> <b>10</b> Meanwhile, the people of Judah said:
</p>

<p>
“The strength of the laborer fails,
</p>

<p>
and there is so much rubble
</p>

<p>
that we will never be able
</p>

<p>
to rebuild the wall.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="4-11"></a> <b>11</b> And our enemies said, “Before they know or see a thing, we will come into their midst, kill them, and put an end to the work.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="4-12"></a> <b>12</b> At that time the Jews who lived nearby came and told us ten times over, “Wherever you turn, they will attack us.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="4-13"></a> <b>13</b> So I stationed men behind the lowest sections of the wall, at the vulnerable areas. I stationed them by families with their swords, spears, and bows.
</p>

<p>
<a id="4-14"></a> <b>14</b> After I had made an inspection, I stood up and said to the nobles, the officials, and the rest of the people, “Do not be afraid of them. Remember the Lord, who is great and awesome, and fight for your brothers, your sons and your daughters, your wives and your homes.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="4-15"></a> <b>15</b> When our enemies heard that we were aware of their scheme and that God had frustrated it, each of us returned to his own work on the wall. 
<a id="4-16"></a> <b>16</b> And from that day on, half of my servants did the work while the other half held spears, shields, bows, and armor.
</p>

<p>
The officers stationed themselves behind all the people of Judah 
<a id="4-17"></a> <b>17</b> who were rebuilding the wall. The laborers who carried materials worked with one hand and held a weapon with the other. 
<a id="4-18"></a> <b>18</b> And each of the builders worked with his sword strapped at his side. But the trumpeter stayed beside me.
</p>

<p>
<a id="4-19"></a> <b>19</b> Then I said to the nobles, the officials, and the rest of the people: “The work is great and extensive, and we are spread out far from one another along the wall. 
<a id="4-20"></a> <b>20</b> Wherever you hear the sound of the horn, rally to us there. Our God will fight for us!”
</p>

<p>
<a id="4-21"></a> <b>21</b> So we continued the work, while half of the men held spears from the break of dawn until the stars came out. 
<a id="4-22"></a> <b>22</b> At that time I also said to the people, “Let every man and his servant spend the night inside Jerusalem, so that they can stand guard by night and work by day.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="4-23"></a> <b>23</b> So neither I nor my brothers nor my servants nor the guards with me changed out of our clothes; each carried his weapon, even to go for water.

</p>

<p>
<a id="5-1"></a> About that time there was a great outcry from the people and their wives against their fellow Jews.
</p>

<p>
<a id="5-2"></a> <b>2</b> Some were saying, “We and our sons and daughters are numerous. We must get grain in order to eat and stay alive.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="5-3"></a> <b>3</b> Others were saying, “We are mortgaging our fields, our vineyards, and our homes to get grain during the famine.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="5-4"></a> <b>4</b> Still others were saying, “We have borrowed money to pay the king&rsquo;s tax on our fields and vineyards. 
<a id="5-5"></a> <b>5</b> We and our children are just like our countrymen and their children, yet we are subjecting our sons and daughters to slavery. Some of our daughters are already enslaved, but we are powerless to redeem them because our fields and vineyards belong to others.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="5-6"></a> <b>6</b> When I heard their outcry and these complaints, I became extremely angry, 
<a id="5-7"></a> <b>7</b> and after serious thought I rebuked the nobles and officials, saying, “You are exacting usury from your own brothers!”
</p>

<p>
So I called a large assembly against them 
<a id="5-8"></a> <b>8</b> and said, “We have done our best to buy back our Jewish brothers who were sold to foreigners, but now you are selling your own brothers, that they may be sold back to us!”
</p>

<p>
But they remained silent, for they could find nothing to say.
</p>

<p>
<a id="5-9"></a> <b>9</b> So I continued, “What you are doing is not right. Shouldn&rsquo;t you walk in the fear of our God to avoid the reproach of our foreign enemies? 
<a id="5-10"></a> <b>10</b> I, as well as my brothers and my servants, have been lending the people money and grain. Please, let us stop this usury. 
<a id="5-11"></a> <b>11</b> Please restore to them immediately their fields, vineyards, olive groves, and houses, along with the percentage of the money, grain, new wine, and oil that you have been assessing them.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="5-12"></a> <b>12</b> “We will restore it,” they replied, “and will require nothing more from them. We will do as you say.”
</p>

<p>
So I summoned the priests and required of the nobles and officials an oath that they would do what they had promised. 
<a id="5-13"></a> <b>13</b> I also shook out the folds of my robe and said, “May God likewise shake out of His house and possession every man who does not keep this promise. May such a man be shaken out and have nothing!”
</p>

<p>
The whole assembly said, “Amen,” and they praised the LORD. And the people did as they had promised.

</p>

<p>
<a id="5-15"></a> <b>15</b> The governors before me had heavily burdened the people, taking from them bread and wine plus forty shekels of silver. Their servants also oppressed the people, but I did not do this because of my fear of God. 
<a id="5-16"></a> <b>16</b> Instead, I devoted myself to the construction of the wall, and all my servants were gathered there for the work; we did not acquire any land.
</p>

<p>
<a id="5-17"></a> <b>17</b> There were 150 Jews and officials at my table, besides the guests from the surrounding nations. 
<a id="5-18"></a> <b>18</b> Each day one ox, six choice sheep, and some fowl were prepared for me, and once every ten days an abundance of all kinds of wine was provided. But I did not demand the food allotted to the governor, because the burden on the people was so heavy.

But they were planning to harm me.
</p>

<p>
<a id="6-3"></a> <b>3</b> So I sent messengers to them, saying, “I am doing a great work and cannot come down. Why should the work stop while I leave it to go down to you?”
</p>

<p>
<a id="6-4"></a> <b>4</b> Four times they sent me the same message, and each time I gave the same reply.
</p>

<p>
<a id="6-5"></a> <b>5</b> The fifth time, Sanballat sent me this same message by his young servant, who had in his hand an unsealed letter 
<a id="6-6"></a> <b>6</b> that read:
</p>

<p>
“It is reported among the nations&#x2014;and Geshem agrees&#x2014;that you and the Jews are plotting to revolt, and this is why you are building the wall. According to these reports, you are to become their king, 
<a id="6-7"></a> <b>7</b> and you have even appointed prophets in Jerusalem to proclaim on your behalf: ‘There is a king in Judah.&rsquo; Soon these rumors will reach the ears of the king. So come, let us confer together.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="6-8"></a> <b>8</b> Then I sent him this reply: “There is nothing to these rumors you are spreading; you are inventing them in your own mind.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="6-9"></a> <b>9</b> For they were all trying to frighten us, saying, “Their hands will be weakened in the work, and it will never be finished.”
</p>

<p>
But now, my God, strengthen my hands.
</p>

<p>
<a id="6-10"></a> <b>10</b> Later, I went to the house of Shemaiah son of Delaiah, the son of Mehetabel, who was confined to his house. He said:
</p>

<p>
“Let us meet at the house of God
</p>

<p>
inside the temple.
</p>

<p>
Let us shut the temple doors
</p>

<p>
because they are coming to kill you&#x2014;
</p>

<p>
by night they are coming to kill you!”
</p>

<p>
<a id="6-11"></a> <b>11</b> But I replied, “Should a man like me run away? Should one like me go into the temple to save his own life? I will not go!”
</p>

<p>
<a id="6-12"></a> <b>12</b> I realized that God had not sent him, but that he had uttered this prophecy against me because Tobiah and Sanballat had hired him. 
<a id="6-13"></a> <b>13</b> He had been hired to intimidate me so that I would sin by doing as he suggested, so they could give me a bad name in order to discredit me.
</p>

<p>
<a id="6-14"></a> <b>14</b> O my God, remember Tobiah and Sanballat for what they have done, and also Noadiah the prophetess and the other prophets who tried to intimidate me.

</p>

<p>
<a id="6-17"></a> <b>17</b> Also in those days, the nobles of Judah sent many letters to Tobiah, and Tobiah&rsquo;s letters came back to them. 
<a id="6-18"></a> <b>18</b> For many in Judah were bound by oath to him, since he was a son-in-law of Shecaniah son of Arah, and his son Jehohanan had married the daughter of Meshullam son of Berechiah.

You heard their cry at the Red Sea.

<a id="9-10"></a> <b>10</b> You performed signs and wonders against Pharaoh,

all his officials, and all the people of his land,

<p>
for You knew they had acted with arrogance

<p>
against our fathers.
</p>

<p>
You made a name for Yourself
</p>

<p>
that endures to this day.
</p>

<p>
<a id="9-11"></a> <b>11</b> You divided the sea before them,

<p>
and they crossed through it on dry ground.
</p>

<p>
You hurled their pursuers into the depths
</p>

like a stone into raging waters.

<p>
<a id="9-12"></a> <b>12</b> You led them with a pillar of cloud by day

to light for them the way

in which they should travel.

<p>
<a id="9-13"></a> <b>13</b> You came down on Mount Sinai

and spoke with them from heaven.

<p>
You gave them just ordinances, true laws,

<p>
<a id="9-14"></a> <b>14</b> You revealed to them Your holy Sabbath

<a id="9-15"></a> <b>15</b> In their hunger You gave them bread from heaven;

You told them to go in and possess the land

<p>
which You had sworn to give them.

<p>
<a id="9-16"></a> <b>16</b> But they and our fathers became arrogant and stiff-necked

and did not obey Your commandments.

<p>
<a id="9-17"></a> <b>17</b> They refused to listen and failed to remember
</p>

<p>
the wonders You performed among them.
</p>

<p>
They stiffened their necks and appointed a leader
</p>

<p>
to return them to their bondage in Egypt.
</p>

<p>
But You are a forgiving God,
</p>

<p>
gracious and compassionate,
</p>

<p>
slow to anger and rich in loving devotion,
</p>

<p>
and You did not forsake them.
</p>

<p>
<a id="9-18"></a> <b>18</b> Even when they cast for themselves
</p>

<p>
an image of a calf and said,
</p>

<p>
‘This is your God who brought you up out of Egypt,&rsquo;

<p>
and when they committed terrible blasphemies,
</p>

<p>
<a id="9-19"></a> <b>19</b> You in Your great compassion

<p>
did not forsake them in the wilderness.
</p>

<p>
By day the pillar of cloud never turned away
</p>

<p>
from guiding them on their path;
</p>

<p>
and by the night the pillar of fire
</p>

<p>
illuminated the way they should go.
</p>

<p>
<a id="9-20"></a> <b>20</b> You gave Your good Spirit to instruct them.
</p>

<p>
You did not withhold Your manna from their mouths,
</p>

<p>
and You gave them water for their thirst.
</p>

<p>
<a id="9-21"></a> <b>21</b> For forty years You sustained them in the wilderness,
</p>

<p>
so that they lacked nothing.
</p>

<p>
Their clothes did not wear out
</p>

<p>
and their feet did not swell.
</p>

<p>
<a id="9-22"></a> <b>22</b> You gave them kingdoms and peoples
</p>

<p>
and allotted to them every corner of the land.
</p>

<p>
So they took the land of Sihon king of Heshbon
</p>

<p>
and of Og king of Bashan.
</p>

<p>
<a id="9-23"></a> <b>23</b> You multiplied their descendants
</p>

like the stars of heaven

<p>
and brought them to the land
</p>

<p>
You had told their fathers to enter and possess.
</p>

<p>
<a id="9-24"></a> <b>24</b> So their descendants went in and possessed the land;
</p>

<p>
You subdued before them the Canaanites dwelling in the land.
</p>

<p>
You delivered into their hands the kings and peoples of the land,
</p>

<p>
to do with them as they wished.
</p>

<p>
<a id="9-25"></a> <b>25</b> They captured fortified cities and fertile land
</p>

<p>
and took houses full of all goods,
</p>

<p>
wells already dug,
</p>

<p>
vineyards, olive groves, and fruit trees in abundance.
</p>

<p>
So they ate and were filled;
</p>

<p>
they grew fat and delighted in Your great goodness.
</p>

<p>
<a id="9-26"></a> <b>26</b> But they were disobedient and rebelled against You;
</p>

<p>
they flung Your law behind their backs.
</p>

<p>
They killed Your prophets,
</p>

<p>
who had admonished them to return to You.
</p>

<p>
They committed terrible blasphemies.
</p>

<p>
<a id="9-27"></a> <b>27</b> So You delivered them into the hands
</p>

<p>
of enemies who oppressed them,
</p>

<p>
and in their time of distress they cried out to You.
</p>

<p>
From heaven You heard them,
</p>

<p>
and in Your great compassion You gave them deliverers
</p>

<p>
who saved them from the hands of their enemies.
</p>

<p>
<a id="9-28"></a> <b>28</b> But as soon as they had rest,
</p>

<p>
they again did evil in Your sight.
</p>

<p>
So You abandoned them to the hands of their enemies,
</p>

<p>
who had dominion over them.
</p>

<p>
When they cried out to You again,
</p>

<p>
You heard from heaven,
</p>

<p>
and You delivered them many times
</p>

<p>
in Your compassion.
</p>

<p>
<a id="9-29"></a> <b>29</b> You admonished them to turn back to Your law,
</p>

<p>
but they were arrogant and disobeyed Your commandments.
</p>

<p>
They sinned against Your ordinances,
</p>

<p>
by which a man will live if he practices them.
</p>

<p>
They stubbornly shrugged their shoulders;
</p>

<p>
they stiffened their necks and would not obey.
</p>

<p>
<a id="9-30"></a> <b>30</b> You were patient with them for many years,
</p>

<p>
and Your Spirit admonished them through Your prophets.
</p>

<p>
Yet they would not listen,
</p>

<p>
so You gave them into the hands of the neighboring peoples.
</p>

<p>
<a id="9-31"></a> <b>31</b> But in Your great compassion,
</p>

<p>
You did not put an end to them;

<p>
nor did You forsake them,
</p>

<p>
for You are a gracious and compassionate God.
</p>

<p>
<a id="9-32"></a> <b>32</b> So now, our God, the great and mighty and awesome God

who keeps His gracious covenant,

do not view lightly all the hardship

that has come upon us,

<p>
while we have acted wickedly.
</p>

<p>
<a id="9-34"></a> <b>34</b> Our kings and leaders and priests and fathers

</p>

<p>
or listen to Your commandments

</p>

<p>
<a id="9-35"></a> <b>35</b> For even while they were in their kingdom,

with the abundant goodness

<p>
that You had given them,

<p>
and in the spacious and fertile land
</p>

<p>
that You had set before them,
</p>

<p>
they would not serve You
</p>

<p>
or turn from their wicked ways.
</p>

<p>
<a id="9-36"></a> <b>36</b> So here we are today as slaves

here we are as slaves!

<p>
<a id="12-7"></a> <b>7</b> Sallu, Amok, Hilkiah, and Jedaiah.
</p>

<p>
These were the leaders of the priests and their associates in the days of Jeshua.
</p>

<p>
<a id="12-8"></a> <b>8</b> The Levites were Jeshua, Binnui, Kadmiel, Sherebiah, Judah, and Mattaniah, who, with his associates, led the songs of thanksgiving. 
<a id="12-9"></a> <b>9</b> Bakbukiah and Unni, their associates, stood across from them in the services.
</p>

<p>
<a id="12-10"></a> <b>10</b> Jeshua was the father of Joiakim,

<p>
Joiakim was the father of Eliashib,

<p>
<a id="12-11"></a> <b>11</b> Joiada was the father of Jonathan,

<p>
and Jonathan was the father of Jaddua.

<p>
<a id="12-12"></a> <b>12</b> In the days of Joiakim, these were the heads of the priestly families:

<p>
of the family of Seraiah, Meraiah;

<p>
<a id="12-22"></a> <b>22</b> In the days of Eliashib, Joiada, Johanan, and Jaddua, during the reign of Darius the Persian, the heads of the families of the Levites and priests were recorded.
</p>

<p>
<a id="12-23"></a> <b>23</b> As for the descendants of Levi, the family heads up to the days of Johanan son of Eliashib were recorded in the Book of the Chronicles. 
<a id="12-24"></a> <b>24</b> The leaders of the Levites were Hashabiah, Sherebiah, and Jeshua son of Kadmiel, along with their associates, who stood across from them to give praise and thanksgiving as one section alternated with the other, as prescribed by David the man of God.
</p>

<p>
<a id="12-25"></a> <b>25</b> Mattaniah, Bakbukiah, Obadiah, Meshullam, Talmon, and Akkub were gatekeepers who guarded the storerooms at the gates. 
<a id="12-26"></a> <b>26</b> They served in the days of Joiakim son of Jeshua, the son of Jozadak, and in the days of Nehemiah the governor and Ezra the priest and scribe.

<h3 id="org9b43f92">The Dedication of the Wall</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org9b43f92">
<p>
<a id="12-27"></a> <b>27</b> At the dedication of the wall of Jerusalem, the Levites were sought out from all their homes and brought to Jerusalem to celebrate the joyous dedication with thanksgiving and singing, accompanied by cymbals, harps, and lyres. 
<a id="12-28"></a> <b>28</b> The singers were also assembled from the region around Jerusalem, from the villages of the Netophathites, 
<a id="12-29"></a> <b>29</b> from Beth-gilgal, and from the fields of Geba and Azmaveth, for they had built villages for themselves around Jerusalem. 
<a id="12-30"></a> <b>30</b> After the priests and Levites had purified themselves, they purified the people, the gates, and the wall.
</p>

<p>
<a id="12-31"></a> <b>31</b> Then I brought the leaders of Judah up on the wall, and I appointed two great thanksgiving choirs. One was to proceed along the top of the wall to the right, toward the Dung Gate. 
<a id="12-32"></a> <b>32</b> Hoshaiah and half the leaders of Judah followed, 
<a id="12-33"></a> <b>33</b> along with Azariah, Ezra, Meshullam, 
<a id="12-34"></a> <b>34</b> Judah, Benjamin, Shemaiah, Jeremiah, 
<a id="12-35"></a> <b>35</b> and some of the priests with trumpets, and also Zechariah son of Jonathan, the son of Shemaiah, the son of Mattaniah, the son of Micaiah, the son of Zaccur, the son of Asaph, 
<a id="12-36"></a> <b>36</b> and his associates&#x2014;Shemaiah, Azarel, Milalai, Gilalai, Maai, Nethanel, Judah, and Hanani&#x2014;with the musical instruments prescribed by David the man of God. Ezra the scribe led the procession. 
<a id="12-37"></a> <b>37</b> At the Fountain Gate they climbed the steps of the City of David on the ascent to the wall and passed above the house of David to the Water Gate on the east.
</p>

<p>
<a id="12-38"></a> <b>38</b> The second thanksgiving choir proceeded to the left, and I followed it with half the people along the top of the wall, past the Tower of the Ovens to the Broad Wall, 
<a id="12-39"></a> <b>39</b> over the Gate of Ephraim, the Jeshanah Gate, the Fish Gate, the Tower of Hananel, and the Tower of the Hundred, as far as the Sheep Gate. And they stopped at the Gate of the Guard.
</p>

<p>
<a id="12-40"></a> <b>40</b> The two thanksgiving choirs then stood in the house of God, as did I, along with the half of the officials accompanying me, 
<a id="12-41"></a> <b>41</b> as well as the priests with their trumpets&#x2014;Eliakim, Maaseiah, Miniamin, Micaiah, Elioenai, Zechariah, and Hananiah&#x2014; 
<a id="12-42"></a> <b>42</b> and also Maaseiah, Shemaiah, Eleazar, Uzzi, Jehohanan, Malchijah, Elam, and Ezer. Then the choirs sang out under the direction of Jezrahiah.
</p>

<p>
<a id="12-43"></a> <b>43</b> On that day they offered great sacrifices, rejoicing because God had given them great joy. The women and children also rejoiced, so that the joy of Jerusalem was heard from afar.

<p>
<a id="12-44"></a> <b>44</b> And on that same day men were appointed over the rooms that housed the supplies, contributions, firstfruits, and tithes. The portions specified by the Law for the priests and Levites were gathered into these storerooms from the fields of the villages, because Judah rejoiced over the priests and Levites who were serving.
</p>

<p>
<a id="12-45"></a> <b>45</b> They performed the service of their God and the service of purification, along with the singers and gatekeepers, as David and his son Solomon had prescribed. 
<a id="12-46"></a> <b>46</b> For long ago, in the days of David and Asaph, there were directors for the singers and for the songs of praise and thanksgiving to God.
</p>

<p>
<a id="12-47"></a> <b>47</b> So in the days of Zerubbabel and Nehemiah, all Israel contributed the daily portions for the singers and gatekeepers. They also set aside daily portions for the Levites, and the Levites set aside daily portions for the descendants of Aaron.

<p>
<a id="13-1"></a> At that time the Book of Moses was read aloud in the hearing of the people, and in it they found the passage stating that no Ammonite or Moabite should ever enter the assembly of God, 
<a id="13-2"></a> <b>2</b> because they had not met the Israelites with food and water, but had hired Balaam to call down a curse against them (although our God had turned the curse into a blessing).
</p>

<p>
<a id="13-3"></a> <b>3</b> As soon as the people heard this law, they excluded from Israel all of foreign descent.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org7bd7480">
<p>
<a id="13-4"></a> <b>4</b> Now before this, Eliashib the priest, a relative of Tobiah, had been put in charge of the storerooms of the house of our God 
<a id="13-5"></a> <b>5</b> and had prepared for Tobiah a large room where they had previously stored the grain offerings, the frankincense, the temple articles, and the tithes of grain, new wine, and oil prescribed for the Levites, singers, and gatekeepers, along with the contributions for the priests.
</p>

<p>
<a id="13-6"></a> <b>6</b> While all this was happening, I was not in Jerusalem, because I had returned to Artaxerxes king of Babylon in the thirty-second year of his reign. Some time later I obtained leave from the king 
<a id="13-7"></a> <b>7</b> to return to Jerusalem. Then I discovered the evil that Eliashib had done on behalf of Tobiah by providing him a room in the courts of the house of God.
</p>

<p>
<a id="13-8"></a> <b>8</b> And I was greatly displeased and threw all of Tobiah&rsquo;s household goods out of the room. 
<a id="13-9"></a> <b>9</b> Then I ordered that the rooms be purified, and I had the articles of the house of God restored to them, along with the grain offerings and frankincense.

<p>
<a id="13-10"></a> <b>10</b> I also learned that because the portions for the Levites had not been given to them, all the Levites and singers responsible for performing the service had gone back to their own fields. 
<a id="13-11"></a> <b>11</b> So I rebuked the officials and asked, “Why has the house of God been neglected?”
</p>

<p>
Then I gathered the Levites and singers together and stationed them at their posts, 
<a id="13-12"></a> <b>12</b> and all Judah brought a tenth of the grain, new wine, and oil into the storerooms. 
<a id="13-13"></a> <b>13</b> I appointed as treasurers over the storerooms Shelemiah the priest, Zadok the scribe, and Pedaiah of the Levites, with Hanan son of Zaccur, the son of Mattaniah, to assist them, because they were considered trustworthy. They were responsible for distributing the supplies to their fellow Levites.
</p>

<p>

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org5b34949">
<p>
<a id="13-15"></a> <b>15</b> In those days I saw people in Judah treading winepresses on the Sabbath and bringing in grain and loading it on donkeys, along with wine, grapes, and figs. All kinds of goods were being brought into Jerusalem on the Sabbath day. So I warned them against selling food on that day. 
<a id="13-16"></a> <b>16</b> Additionally, men of Tyre who lived there were importing fish and all kinds of merchandise and selling them on the Sabbath to the people of Judah in Jerusalem.
</p>

<p>
<a id="13-17"></a> <b>17</b> Then I rebuked the nobles of Judah and asked, “What is this evil you are doing&#x2014;profaning the Sabbath day? 
<a id="13-18"></a> <b>18</b> Did not your forefathers do the same things, so that our God brought all this disaster on us and on this city? And now you are rekindling His wrath against Israel by profaning the Sabbath!”
</p>

<p>
<a id="13-19"></a> <b>19</b> When the evening shadows began to fall on the gates of Jerusalem, just before the Sabbath, I ordered that the gates be shut and not opened until after the Sabbath. I posted some of my servants at the gates so that no load could enter on the Sabbath day.
</p>

<p>
<a id="13-20"></a> <b>20</b> Once or twice, the merchants and those who sell all kinds of goods camped outside Jerusalem, 
<a id="13-21"></a> <b>21</b> but I warned them, “Why are you camping in front of the wall? If you do it again, I will lay hands on you.” From that time on, they did not return on the Sabbath. 
<a id="13-22"></a> <b>22</b> Then I instructed the Levites to purify themselves and guard the gates in order to keep the Sabbath day holy.
</p>

<p>
Remember me for this as well, O my God, and show me mercy according to Your abundant loving devotion.

<a id="13-23"></a> <b>23</b> In those days I also saw Jews who had married women from Ashdod, Ammon, and Moab. 
<a id="13-24"></a> <b>24</b> Half of their children spoke the language of Ashdod or of the other peoples, but could not speak the language of Judah. 
<a id="13-25"></a> <b>25</b> I rebuked them and called down curses on them. I beat some of these men and pulled out their hair.
</p>

<p>
Then I made them take an oath before God and said, “You must not give your daughters in marriage to their sons or take their daughters as wives for your sons or for yourselves! 
<a id="13-26"></a> <b>26</b> Did not King Solomon of Israel sin in matters like this? There was not a king like him among many nations, and he was loved by his God, who made him king over all Israel&#x2014;yet foreign women drew him into sin. 
<a id="13-27"></a> <b>27</b> Must we now hear that you too are doing all this terrible evil and acting unfaithfully against our God by marrying foreign women?”
</p>

<p>
<a id="13-28"></a> <b>28</b> Even one of the sons of Jehoiada son of Eliashib the high priest had become a son-in-law to Sanballat the Horonite. Therefore I drove him away from me.

<a id="13-29"></a> <b>29</b> Remember them, O my God, because they have defiled the priesthood and the covenant of the priesthood and of the Levites.

<p>
<a id="13-30"></a> <b>30</b> Thus I purified the priests and Levites from everything foreign, and I assigned specific duties to each of the priests and Levites.

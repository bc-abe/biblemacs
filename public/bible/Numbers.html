<p>
<a id="1-3"></a> <b>3</b> You and Aaron are to number those who are twenty years of age or older by their divisions&#x2014;everyone who can serve in Israel&rsquo;s army.

<p>
<a id="1-47"></a> <b>47</b> The Levites, however, were not numbered along with them by the tribe of their fathers.

<a id="1-49"></a> <b>49</b> “Do not number the tribe of Levi in the census with the other Israelites. 
<a id="1-50"></a> <b>50</b> Instead, you are to appoint the Levites over the tabernacle of the Testimony, all its furnishings, and everything in it. They shall carry the tabernacle and all its articles, care for it, and camp around it.
</p>

<p>
<a id="1-51"></a> <b>51</b> Whenever the tabernacle is to move, the Levites are to take it down, and whenever it is to be pitched, the Levites are to set it up. Any outsider who goes near it must be put to death.
</p>

<p>
<a id="1-52"></a> <b>52</b> The Israelites are to camp by their divisions, each man in his own camp and under his own standard. 
<a id="1-53"></a> <b>53</b> But the Levites are to camp around the tabernacle of the Testimony and watch over it, so that no wrath will fall on the congregation of Israel. So the Levites are responsible for the tabernacle of the Testimony.”

<a id="3-46"></a> <b>46</b> To redeem the 273 firstborn Israelites who outnumber the Levites, 
<a id="3-47"></a> <b>47</b> you are to collect five shekels for each one, according to the sanctuary shekel of twenty gerahs. 
<a id="3-48"></a> <b>48</b> Give the money to Aaron and his sons as the redemption price for the excess among the Israelites.”

<p>
<a id="6-5"></a> <b>5</b> For the entire period of his vow of separation, no razor shall pass over his head. He must be holy until the time of his separation to the LORD is complete; he must let the hair of his head grow long.

<a id="6-11"></a> <b>11</b> And the priest is to offer one as a sin offering and the other as a burnt offering to make atonement for him, because he has sinned by being in the presence of the dead body. On that day he must consecrate his head again.

<p>
<a id="6-16"></a> <b>16</b> The priest is to present all these before the LORD and make the sin offering and the burnt offering. 
<a id="6-17"></a> <b>17</b> He shall also offer the ram as a peace offering to the LORD, along with the basket of unleavened bread. And the priest is to offer the accompanying grain offering and drink offering.
</p>

<p>
<a id="6-18"></a> <b>18</b> Then at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting, the Nazirite is to shave his consecrated head, take the hair, and put it on the fire under the peace offering. 
<a id="6-19"></a> <b>19</b> And the priest is to take the boiled shoulder from the ram, one unleavened cake from the basket, and one unleavened wafer, and put them into the hands of the Nazirite who has just shaved the hair of his consecration. 
<a id="6-20"></a> <b>20</b> The priest shall then wave them as a wave offering before the LORD. This is a holy portion for the priest, in addition to the breast of the wave offering and the thigh that was presented. After that, the Nazirite may drink wine.

<a id="8-7"></a> <b>7</b> This is what you must do to cleanse them: Sprinkle them with the water of purification. Have them shave their whole bodies and wash their clothes, and so purify themselves.
</p>

<p>
<a id="8-8"></a> <b>8</b> Then have them take a young bull with its grain offering of fine flour mixed with oil, and you are to take a second young bull for a sin offering. 
<a id="8-9"></a> <b>9</b> Bring the Levites before the Tent of Meeting and assemble the whole congregation of Israel. 
<a id="8-10"></a> <b>10</b> You are to present the Levites before the LORD and have the Israelites lay their hands upon them. 
<a id="8-11"></a> <b>11</b> Aaron is to present the Levites before the LORD as a wave offering from the sons of Israel, so that they may perform the service of the LORD. 
<a id="8-12"></a> <b>12</b> And the Levites are to lay their hands on the heads of the bulls, and offer to the LORD one as a sin offering and the other as a burnt offering, to make atonement for the Levites.
</p>

<p>
<a id="8-13"></a> <b>13</b> You are to have the Levites stand before Aaron and his sons and then present them before the LORD as a wave offering. 
<a id="8-14"></a> <b>14</b> In this way you shall separate the Levites from the rest of the Israelites, and the Levites will belong to Me. 
<a id="8-15"></a> <b>15</b> After you have cleansed them and presented them as a wave offering, they may come to serve at the Tent of Meeting.

<p>
<a id="8-16"></a> <b>16</b> For the Levites have been wholly given to Me from among the sons of Israel. I have taken them for Myself in place of all who come first from the womb, the firstborn of all the sons of Israel. 
<a id="8-17"></a> <b>17</b> For every firstborn male in Israel is Mine, both man and beast. I set them apart for Myself on the day I struck down all the firstborn in the land of Egypt. 
<a id="8-18"></a> <b>18</b> But I have taken the Levites in place of all the firstborn among the sons of Israel. 
<a id="8-19"></a> <b>19</b> And I have given the Levites as a gift to Aaron and his sons from among the Israelites, to perform the service for the Israelites at the Tent of Meeting and to make atonement on their behalf, so that no plague will come against the Israelites when they approach the sanctuary.”

<a id="9-1"></a> In the first month of the second year after Israel had come out of the land of Egypt, the LORD spoke to Moses in the Wilderness of Sinai:
<a id="9-2"></a> <b>2</b> “The Israelites are to observe the Passover at its appointed time. 
<a id="9-3"></a> <b>3</b> You are to observe it at the appointed time, at twilight on the fourteenth day of this month, in accordance with its statutes and ordinances.”

<p>
<a id="9-4"></a> <b>4</b> So Moses told the Israelites to observe the Passover, 
<a id="9-5"></a> <b>5</b> and they did so in the Wilderness of Sinai, at twilight on the fourteenth day of the first month. The Israelites did everything just as the LORD had commanded Moses.
</p>

<p>
<a id="9-6"></a> <b>6</b> But there were some men who were unclean due to a dead body, so they could not observe the Passover on that day. And they came before Moses and Aaron that same day 
<a id="9-7"></a> <b>7</b> and said to Moses, “We are unclean because of a dead body, but why should we be excluded from presenting the LORD&rsquo;s offering with the other Israelites at the appointed time?”
<a id="9-8"></a> <b>8</b> “Wait here until I find out what the LORD commands concerning you,” Moses replied.
</p>

<p>
<a id="9-9"></a> <b>9</b> Then the LORD said to Moses,
<a id="9-10"></a> <b>10</b> “Tell the Israelites: ‘When any one of you or your descendants is unclean because of a dead body, or is away on a journey, he may still observe the Passover to the LORD. 
<a id="9-11"></a> <b>11</b> Such people are to observe it at twilight on the fourteenth day of the second month. They are to eat the lamb, together with unleavened bread and bitter herbs; 
<a id="9-12"></a> <b>12</b> they may not leave any of it until morning or break any of its bones. They must observe the Passover according to all its statutes.
</p>

<p>
<a id="9-13"></a> <b>13</b> But if a man who is ceremonially clean and is not on a journey still fails to observe the Passover, he must be cut off from his people, because he did not present the LORD&rsquo;s offering at its appointed time. That man will bear the consequences of his sin.
</p>

<p>
<a id="9-14"></a> <b>14</b> If a foreigner dwelling among you wants to observe the Passover to the LORD, he is to do so according to the Passover statute and its ordinances. You are to apply the same statute to both the foreigner and the native of the land.&rsquo; ”

<a id="10-26"></a> <b>26</b> Pagiel son of Ocran was over the division of the tribe of Asher, 
<a id="10-27"></a> <b>27</b> and Ahira son of Enan was over the division of the tribe of Naphtali.
</p>

<p>
<a id="10-28"></a> <b>28</b> This was the order of march for the Israelite divisions as they set out.
</p>

<p>
<a id="10-29"></a> <b>29</b> Then Moses said to Hobab, the son of Moses&rsquo; father-in-law Reuel the Midianite, “We are setting out for the place of which the LORD said: ‘I will give it to you.&rsquo; Come with us, and we will treat you well, for the LORD has promised good things to Israel.”
<a id="10-30"></a> <b>30</b> “I will not go,” Hobab replied. “Instead, I am going back to my own land and my own people.”
<a id="10-31"></a> <b>31</b> “Please do not leave us,” Moses said, “since you know where we should camp in the wilderness, and you can serve as our eyes. 
<a id="10-32"></a> <b>32</b> If you come with us, we will share with you whatever good things the LORD gives us.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="10-33"></a> <b>33</b> So they set out on a three-day journey from the mountain of the LORD, with the ark of the covenant of the LORD traveling ahead of them for those three days to seek a resting place for them. 
<a id="10-34"></a> <b>34</b> And the cloud of the LORD was over them by day when they set out from the camp.
</p>

<p>
<a id="10-35"></a> <b>35</b> Whenever the ark set out, Moses would say,
“Rise up, O LORD!

<p>
<a id="11-4"></a> <b>4</b> Meanwhile, the rabble among them had a strong craving for other food, and again the Israelites wept and said, “Who will feed us meat?

<p>
<a id="11-11"></a> <b>11</b> So Moses asked the LORD, “Why have You brought this trouble on Your servant? Why have I not found favor in Your sight, that You have laid upon me the burden of all these people? 
<a id="11-12"></a> <b>12</b> Did I conceive all these people? Did I give them birth, so that You should tell me, ‘Carry them in your bosom, as a nurse carries an infant,&rsquo; to the land that You swore to give their fathers?

<a id="11-16"></a> <b>16</b> Then the LORD said to Moses, “Bring Me seventy of the elders of Israel known to you as leaders and officers of the people. Bring them to the Tent of Meeting and have them stand there with you.
</p>

<p>
<a id="11-17"></a> <b>17</b> And I will come down and speak with you there, and I will take some of the Spirit that is on you and put that Spirit on them. They will help you bear the burden of the people, so that you do not have to bear it by yourself.
</p>

<p>
<a id="11-18"></a> <b>18</b> And say to the people: Consecrate yourselves for tomorrow, and you will eat meat, because you have cried out in the hearing of the LORD, saying: ‘Who will feed us meat? For we were better off in Egypt!&rsquo; Therefore the LORD will give you meat, and you will eat. 
<a id="11-19"></a> <b>19</b> You will eat it not for one or two days, nor for five or ten or twenty days, 
<a id="11-20"></a> <b>20</b> but for a whole month&#x2014;until it comes out of your nostrils and makes you nauseous&#x2014;because you have rejected the LORD, who is among you, and have cried out before Him, saying, ‘Why did we ever leave Egypt?&rsquo; ”
</p>

<p>
<a id="11-21"></a> <b>21</b> But Moses replied, “Here I am among 600,000 men on foot, yet You say, ‘I will give them meat, and they will eat for a month.&rsquo; 
<a id="11-22"></a> <b>22</b> If all our flocks and herds were slaughtered for them, would they have enough? Or if all the fish in the sea were caught for them, would they have enough?”
</p>

<p>
<a id="11-23"></a> <b>23</b> The LORD answered Moses, “Is the LORD&rsquo;s arm too short? Now you will see whether or not My word will come to pass.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="11-24"></a> <b>24</b> So Moses went out and relayed to the people the words of the LORD, and he gathered seventy of the elders of the people and had them stand around the tent. 
<a id="11-25"></a> <b>25</b> Then the LORD came down in the cloud and spoke to him, and He took some of the Spirit that was on Moses and placed that Spirit on the seventy elders. As the Spirit rested on them, they prophesied&#x2014;but they never did so again.
</p>

<p>
<a id="11-26"></a> <b>26</b> Two men, however, had remained in the camp&#x2014;one named Eldad and the other Medad&#x2014;and the Spirit rested on them. They were among those listed, but they had not gone out to the tent, and they prophesied in the camp. 
<a id="11-27"></a> <b>27</b> A young man ran and reported to Moses, “Eldad and Medad are prophesying in the camp.”

<a id="12-2"></a> <b>2</b> “Does the LORD speak only through Moses?” they said. “Does He not also speak through us?” And the LORD heard this.

<p>

</p>

<p>
<a id="12-4"></a> <b>4</b> And suddenly the LORD said to Moses, Aaron, and Miriam, “You three, come out to the Tent of Meeting.” So the three went out, 
<a id="12-5"></a> <b>5</b> and the LORD came down in a pillar of cloud, stood at the entrance to the Tent, and summoned Aaron and Miriam. When both of them had stepped forward, 
<a id="12-6"></a> <b>6</b> He said, “Hear now My words:
If there is a prophet among you,
I, the LORD, will reveal Myself to him in a vision;
I will speak to him in a dream.
</p>

<p>
<a id="12-7"></a> <b>7</b> But this is not so with My servant Moses;
he is faithful in all My house.

clearly and not in riddles;
he sees the form of the LORD.
Why then were you unafraid to speak against My servant Moses?” 
<a id="12-9"></a> <b>9</b> So the anger of the LORD burned against them, and He departed.
</p>

<p>
<a id="12-10"></a> <b>10</b> As the cloud lifted from above the Tent, suddenly Miriam became leprous, white as snow. Aaron turned toward her, saw that she was leprous, 
<a id="12-11"></a> <b>11</b> and said to Moses, “My lord, please do not hold against us this sin we have so foolishly committed. 
<a id="12-12"></a> <b>12</b> Please do not let her be like a stillborn infant whose flesh is half consumed when he comes out of his mother&rsquo;s womb.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="12-13"></a> <b>13</b> So Moses cried out to the LORD, “O God, please heal her!”
</p>

<p>
<a id="12-14"></a> <b>14</b> But the LORD answered Moses, “If her father had but spit in her face, would she not have been in disgrace for seven days? Let her be confined outside the camp for seven days; after that she may be brought back in.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="12-15"></a> <b>15</b> So Miriam was confined outside the camp for seven days, and the people did not move on until she was brought in again.

<p>
<a id="13-16"></a> <b>16</b> These were the names of the men Moses sent to spy out the land; and Moses gave to Hoshea son of Nun the name Joshua.
</p>

<p>
<a id="13-17"></a> <b>17</b> When Moses sent them to spy out the land of Canaan, he told them, “Go up through the Negev and into the hill country. 
<a id="13-18"></a> <b>18</b> See what the land is like and whether its people are strong or weak, few or many. 
<a id="13-19"></a> <b>19</b> Is the land where they live good or bad? Are the cities where they dwell open camps or fortifications? 
<a id="13-20"></a> <b>20</b> Is the soil fertile or unproductive? Are there trees in it or not? Be courageous, and bring back some of the fruit of the land.” (It was the season for the first ripe grapes.)
</p>

<p>
<a id="13-21"></a> <b>21</b> So they went up and spied out the land from the Wilderness of Zin as far as Rehob, toward Lebo-hamath. 
<a id="13-22"></a> <b>22</b> They went up through the Negev and came to Hebron, where Ahiman, Sheshai, and Talmai, the descendants of Anak, dwelled. It had been built seven years before Zoan in Egypt.
</p>

<p>
<a id="13-23"></a> <b>23</b> When they came to the Valley of Eshcol, they cut down a branch with a single cluster of grapes, which they carried on a pole between two men. They also took some pomegranates and figs.

<a id="13-27"></a> <b>27</b> And they gave this account to Moses: “We went into the land to which you sent us, and indeed, it is flowing with milk and honey. Here is some of its fruit!

<a id="14-32"></a> <b>32</b> As for you, however, your bodies will fall in this wilderness.
</p>

<p>
<a id="14-33"></a> <b>33</b> Your children will be shepherds in the wilderness for forty years, and they will suffer for your unfaithfulness until the last of your bodies lies in the wilderness. 
<a id="14-34"></a> <b>34</b> In keeping with the forty days you spied out the land, you shall bear your guilt forty years&#x2014;a year for each day&#x2014;and you will experience My alienation.

<p>

<a id="16-3"></a> <b>3</b> They came together against Moses and Aaron and told them, “You have taken too much upon yourselves! For everyone in the entire congregation is holy, and the LORD is in their midst. Why then do you exalt yourselves above the assembly of the LORD?”
</p>

<p>
<a id="16-4"></a> <b>4</b> When Moses heard this, he fell facedown. 
<a id="16-5"></a> <b>5</b> Then he said to Korah and all his followers, “Tomorrow morning the LORD will reveal who belongs to Him and who is holy, and He will bring that person near to Himself. The one He chooses, He will bring near to Himself. 
<a id="16-6"></a> <b>6</b> You, Korah, and all your followers are to do as follows: Take censers,

</p>

<p>
<a id="16-8"></a> <b>8</b> Moses also said to Korah, “Now listen, you sons of Levi! 
<a id="16-9"></a> <b>9</b> Is it not enough for you that the God of Israel has separated you from the congregation of Israel and brought you near to Himself to perform the work at the LORD&rsquo;s tabernacle, and to stand before the congregation to minister to them? 
<a id="16-10"></a> <b>10</b> He has brought you near, you and all your fellow Levites, but you are seeking the priesthood as well. 
<a id="16-11"></a> <b>11</b> Therefore, it is you and all your followers who have conspired against the LORD! As for Aaron, who is he that you should grumble against him?”
</p>

<p>
<a id="16-12"></a> <b>12</b> Then Moses summoned Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab, but they said, “We will not come! 
<a id="16-13"></a> <b>13</b> Is it not enough that you have brought us up out of a land flowing with milk and honey to kill us in the wilderness? Must you also appoint yourself as ruler over us? 
<a id="16-14"></a> <b>14</b> Moreover, you have not brought us into a land flowing with milk and honey or given us an inheritance of fields and vineyards. Will you gouge out the eyes of these men? No, we will not come!”
</p>

<p>
<a id="16-15"></a> <b>15</b> Then Moses became very angry and said to the LORD, “Do not regard their offering. I have not taken one donkey from them or mistreated a single one of them.”

<p>
<a id="16-16"></a> <b>16</b> And Moses said to Korah, “You and all your followers are to appear before the LORD tomorrow&#x2014;you and they and Aaron.

<a id="18-3"></a> <b>3</b> And they shall attend to your duties and to all the duties of the Tent; but they must not come near to the furnishings of the sanctuary or the altar, or both they and you will die. 
<a id="18-4"></a> <b>4</b> They are to join you and attend to the duties of the Tent of Meeting, doing all the work at the Tent; but no outsider may come near you.
</p>

<p>
<a id="18-5"></a> <b>5</b> And you shall attend to the duties of the sanctuary and of the altar, so that wrath may not fall on the Israelites again. 
<a id="18-6"></a> <b>6</b> Behold, I Myself have selected your fellow Levites from the Israelites as a gift to you, dedicated to the LORD to perform the service for the Tent of Meeting. 
<a id="18-7"></a> <b>7</b> But only you and your sons shall attend to your priesthood for everything concerning the altar and what is inside the veil, and you are to perform that service.

<p>
<a id="18-8"></a> <b>8</b> Then the LORD said to Aaron, “Behold, I have put you in charge of My offerings. As for all the sacred offerings of the Israelites, I have given them to you and your sons as a portion and a permanent statute. 
<a id="18-9"></a> <b>9</b> A portion of the most holy offerings reserved from the fire will be yours. From all the offerings they render to Me as most holy offerings, whether grain offerings or sin offerings or guilt offerings, that part belongs to you and your sons. 
<a id="18-10"></a> <b>10</b> You are to eat it as a most holy offering, and every male may eat it. You shall regard it as holy.
</p>

<p>
<a id="18-11"></a> <b>11</b> And this is yours as well: the offering of their gifts, along with all the wave offerings of the Israelites. I have given this to you and your sons and daughters as a permanent statute. Every ceremonially clean person in your household may eat it. 
<a id="18-12"></a> <b>12</b> I give you all the freshest olive oil and all the finest new wine and grain that the Israelites give to the LORD as their firstfruits. 
<a id="18-13"></a> <b>13</b> The firstfruits of everything in their land that they bring to the LORD will belong to you. Every ceremonially clean person in your household may eat them.
</p>

<p>
<a id="18-14"></a> <b>14</b> Every devoted thing in Israel belongs to you. 
<a id="18-15"></a> <b>15</b> The firstborn of every womb, whether man or beast, that is offered to the LORD belongs to you. But you must surely redeem every firstborn son and every firstborn male of unclean animals. 
<a id="18-16"></a> <b>16</b> You are to pay the redemption price for a month-old male according to your valuation: five shekels of silver, according to the sanctuary shekel, which is twenty gerahs.
</p>

<p>
<a id="18-17"></a> <b>17</b> But you must not redeem the firstborn of an ox, a sheep, or a goat; they are holy. You are to sprinkle their blood on the altar and burn their fat as an offering made by fire, a pleasing aroma to the LORD. 
<a id="18-18"></a> <b>18</b> And their meat belongs to you, just as the breast and right thigh of the wave offering belong to you.
</p>

<p>
<a id="18-19"></a> <b>19</b> All the holy offerings that the Israelites present to the LORD I give to you and to your sons and daughters as a permanent statute. It is a permanent covenant of salt before the LORD for you and your offspring.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="18-20"></a> <b>20</b> Then the LORD said to Aaron, “You will have no inheritance in their land, nor will you have any portion among them. I am your portion and your inheritance among the Israelites.
</p>

<p>
<a id="18-21"></a> <b>21</b> Behold, I have given to the Levites all the tithes in Israel as an inheritance in return for the work they do, the service of the Tent of Meeting. 
<a id="18-22"></a> <b>22</b> No longer may the Israelites come near to the Tent of Meeting, or they will incur guilt and die.
</p>

<p>
<a id="18-23"></a> <b>23</b> The Levites are to perform the work of the Tent of Meeting, and they must bear their iniquity. This is a permanent statute for the generations to come. The Levites will not receive an inheritance among the Israelites. 
<a id="18-24"></a> <b>24</b> For I have given to the Levites as their inheritance the tithe that the Israelites present to the LORD as a contribution. That is why I told them that they would not receive an inheritance among the Israelites.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="18-25"></a> <b>25</b> And the LORD instructed Moses,
<a id="18-26"></a> <b>26</b> “Speak to the Levites and tell them: ‘When you receive from the Israelites the tithe that I have given you as your inheritance, you must present part of it as an offering to the LORD&#x2014;a tithe of the tithe. 
<a id="18-27"></a> <b>27</b> Your offering will be reckoned to you as grain from the threshing floor or juice from the winepress. 
<a id="18-28"></a> <b>28</b> So you are to present an offering to the LORD from all the tithes you receive from the Israelites, and from these you are to give the LORD&rsquo;s offering to Aaron the priest. 
<a id="18-29"></a> <b>29</b> You must present the offering due the LORD from all the best of every gift, the holiest part of it.&rsquo;
</p>

<p>
<a id="18-30"></a> <b>30</b> Therefore say to the Levites, ‘When you have presented the best part, it will be reckoned to you as the produce of the threshing floor or winepress. 
<a id="18-31"></a> <b>31</b> And you and your households may eat the rest of it anywhere; it is the compensation for your work at the Tent of Meeting. 
<a id="18-32"></a> <b>32</b> Once you have presented the best part of it, you will not incur guilt because of it. But you must not defile the sacred offerings of the Israelites, or else you will die.&rsquo; ”

<a id="19-9"></a> <b>9</b> Then a man who is ceremonially clean is to gather up the ashes of the heifer and store them in a ceremonially clean place outside the camp. They must be kept by the congregation of Israel for preparing the water of purification; this is for purification from sin. 
<a id="19-10"></a> <b>10</b> The man who has gathered up the ashes of the heifer must also wash his clothes, and he will be ceremonially unclean until evening. This is a permanent statute for the Israelites and for the foreigner residing among them.

<a id="20-2"></a> <b>2</b> Now there was no water for the congregation, so they gathered against Moses and Aaron. 
<a id="20-3"></a> <b>3</b> The people quarreled with Moses and said, “If only we had perished with our brothers before the LORD! 
<a id="20-4"></a> <b>4</b> Why have you brought the LORD&rsquo;s assembly into this wilderness for us and our livestock to die here? 
<a id="20-5"></a> <b>5</b> Why have you led us up out of Egypt to bring us to this wretched place? It is not a place of grain, figs, vines, or pomegranates&#x2014;and there is no water to drink!”
</p>

<p>
<a id="20-6"></a> <b>6</b> Then Moses and Aaron went from the presence of the assembly to the entrance to the Tent of Meeting. They fell facedown, and the glory of the LORD appeared to them.

<a id="20-11"></a> <b>11</b> Then Moses raised his hand and struck the rock twice with his staff, so that a great amount of water gushed out, and the congregation and their livestock were able to drink.

<p>
<a id="20-12"></a> <b>12</b> But the LORD said to Moses and Aaron, “Because you did not trust Me to show My holiness in the sight of the Israelites, you will not bring this assembly into the land that I have given them.”

<a id="20-18"></a> <b>18</b> But Edom answered, “You may not travel through our land, or we will come out and confront you with the sword.”

<a id="22-2"></a> <b>2</b> Now Balak son of Zippor saw all that Israel had done to the Amorites, 
<a id="22-3"></a> <b>3</b> and Moab was terrified of the people because they were numerous. Indeed, Moab dreaded the Israelites. 
<a id="22-4"></a> <b>4</b> So the Moabites said to the elders of Midian, “This horde will devour everything around us, as an ox licks up the grass of the field.”
Since Balak son of Zippor was king of Moab at that time, 
<a id="22-5"></a> <b>5</b> he sent messengers to Balaam son of Beor at Pethor, which is by the Euphrates in the land of his people.
“Behold, a people has come out of Egypt,” said Balak. “They cover the face of the land and have settled next to me. 
<a id="22-6"></a> <b>6</b> So please come now and put a curse on this people, because they are too mighty for me. Perhaps I may be able to defeat them and drive them out of the land; for I know that those you bless are blessed, and those you curse are cursed.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="22-7"></a> <b>7</b> The elders of Moab and Midian departed with the fees for divination in hand. They came to Balaam and relayed to him the words of Balak.
<a id="22-8"></a> <b>8</b> “Spend the night here,” Balaam replied, “and I will give you the answer that the LORD speaks to me.” So the princes of Moab stayed with Balaam.
</p>

<p>
<a id="22-9"></a> <b>9</b> Then God came to Balaam and asked, “Who are these men with you?”
</p>

<p>
<a id="22-10"></a> <b>10</b> And Balaam said to God, “Balak son of Zippor, king of Moab, sent me this message: 11‘Behold, a people has come out of Egypt, and they cover the face of the land. Now come and put a curse on them for me. Perhaps I may be able to fight against them and drive them away.&rsquo; ”
</p>

<p>
<a id="22-12"></a> <b>12</b> But God said to Balaam, “Do not go with them. You are not to curse this people, for they are blessed.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="22-13"></a> <b>13</b> So Balaam got up the next morning and said to Balak&rsquo;s princes, “Go back to your homeland, because the LORD has refused to let me go with you.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="22-14"></a> <b>14</b> And the princes of Moab arose, returned to Balak, and said, “Balaam refused to come with us.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="22-15"></a> <b>15</b> Then Balak sent other princes, more numerous and more distinguished than the first messengers. 
<a id="22-16"></a> <b>16</b> They came to Balaam and said, “This is what Balak son of Zippor says: ‘Please let nothing hinder you from coming to me, 
<a id="22-17"></a> <b>17</b> for I will honor you richly and do whatever you say. So please come and put a curse on this people for me!&rsquo; ”
</p>

<p>
<a id="22-18"></a> <b>18</b> But Balaam replied to the servants of Balak, “If Balak were to give me his house full of silver and gold, I could not do anything small or great to go beyond the command of the LORD my God. 
<a id="22-19"></a> <b>19</b> So now, please stay here overnight as the others did, that I may find out what else the LORD has to tell me.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="22-20"></a> <b>20</b> That night God came to Balaam and said, “Since these men have come to summon you, get up and go with them, but you must only do what I tell you.” 
<a id="22-21"></a> <b>21</b> So in the morning Balaam got up, saddled his donkey, and went with the princes of Moab.
</p>

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org583d2a0">
<p>
<a id="22-22"></a> <b>22</b> Then God&rsquo;s anger was kindled because Balaam was going along, and the angel of the LORD stood in the road to oppose him. Balaam was riding his donkey, and his two servants were with him.
</p>

<p>
<a id="22-23"></a> <b>23</b> When the donkey saw the angel of the LORD standing in the road with a drawn sword in his hand, she turned off the path and went into a field. So Balaam beat her to return her to the path.
</p>

<p>
<a id="22-24"></a> <b>24</b> Then the angel of the LORD stood in a narrow passage between two vineyards, with walls on either side. 
<a id="22-25"></a> <b>25</b> And the donkey saw the angel of the LORD and pressed herself against the wall, crushing Balaam&rsquo;s foot against it. So he beat her once again.
</p>

<p>
<a id="22-26"></a> <b>26</b> And the angel of the LORD moved on ahead and stood in a narrow place where there was no room to turn to the right or left. 
<a id="22-27"></a> <b>27</b> When the donkey saw the angel of the LORD, she lay down under Balaam, and he became furious and beat her with his staff.
</p>

<p>
<a id="22-28"></a> <b>28</b> Then the LORD opened the donkey&rsquo;s mouth, and she said to Balaam, “What have I done to you that you have beaten me these three times?”
</p>

<p>
<a id="22-29"></a> <b>29</b> Balaam answered the donkey, “You have made a fool of me! If I had a sword in my hand, I would kill you right now!”
</p>

<p>
<a id="22-30"></a> <b>30</b> But the donkey said to Balaam, “Am I not the donkey you have ridden all your life until today? Have I ever treated you this way before?”
“No,” he replied.
</p>

<p>
<a id="22-31"></a> <b>31</b> Then the LORD opened Balaam&rsquo;s eyes, and he saw the angel of the LORD standing in the road with a drawn sword in his hand. And Balaam bowed low and fell facedown.
</p>

<p>
<a id="22-32"></a> <b>32</b> The angel of the LORD asked him, “Why have you beaten your donkey these three times? Behold, I have come out to oppose you, because your way is perverse before me. 
<a id="22-33"></a> <b>33</b> The donkey saw me and turned away from me these three times. If she had not turned away, then by now I would surely have killed you and let her live.”
<a id="22-34"></a> <b>34</b> “I have sinned,” Balaam said to the angel of the LORD, “for I did not realize that you were standing in the road to confront me. And now, if this is displeasing in your sight, I will go back home.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="22-35"></a> <b>35</b> But the angel of the LORD said to Balaam, “Go with the men, but you are to speak only what I tell you.” So Balaam went with the princes of Balak.
</p>

<p>
<a id="22-36"></a> <b>36</b> When Balak heard that Balaam was coming, he went out to meet him at the Moabite city on the Arnon border, at the edge of his territory. 
<a id="22-37"></a> <b>37</b> And he said to Balaam, “Did I not send you an urgent summons? Why did you not come to me? Am I really not able to richly reward you?”
<a id="22-38"></a> <b>38</b> “See, I have come to you,” Balaam replied, “but can I say just anything? I must speak only the word that God puts in my mouth.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="22-39"></a> <b>39</b> So Balaam accompanied Balak, and they came to Kiriath-huzoth. 
<a id="22-40"></a> <b>40</b> Balak sacrificed cattle and sheep, and he gave portions to Balaam and the princes who were with him.
</p>

<p>
<a id="22-41"></a> <b>41</b> The next morning, Balak took Balaam and brought him up to Bamoth-baal. From there he could see the outskirts of the camp of the people.

So Balaam went off to a barren height,

<a id="23-7"></a> <b>7</b> And Balaam lifted up an oracle, saying:
“Balak brought me from Aram,
the king of Moab from the mountains of the east.
‘Come,&rsquo; he said, ‘put a curse on Jacob for me;

</p>

<p>
<a id="23-8"></a> <b>8</b> How can I curse what God has not cursed?
How can I denounce what the LORD has not denounced?
</p>

<p>

<a id="23-11"></a> <b>11</b> Then Balak said to Balaam, “What have you done to me? I brought you here to curse my enemies, and behold, you have only blessed them!”

<a id="23-14"></a> <b>14</b> So Balak took him to the field of Zophim, to the top of Pisgah, where he built seven altars and offered a bull and a ram on each altar.

<p>
<a id="31-1"></a> And the LORD said to Moses,
<a id="31-2"></a> <b>2</b> “Take vengeance on the Midianites for the Israelites. After that, you will be gathered to your people.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="31-3"></a> <b>3</b> So Moses told the people, “Arm some of your men for war, that they may go against the Midianites and execute the LORD&rsquo;s vengeance on them. 
<a id="31-4"></a> <b>4</b> Send into battle a thousand men from each tribe of Israel.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="31-5"></a> <b>5</b> So a thousand men were recruited from each tribe of Israel&#x2014;twelve thousand armed for war. 
<a id="31-6"></a> <b>6</b> And Moses sent the thousand from each tribe into battle, along with Phinehas son of Eleazar the priest, who took with him the vessels of the sanctuary and the trumpets for signaling.
</p>

<p>
<a id="31-7"></a> <b>7</b> Then they waged war against Midian, as the LORD had commanded Moses, and they killed every male. 
<a id="31-8"></a> <b>8</b> Among the slain were Evi, Rekem, Zur, Hur, and Reba&#x2014;the five kings of Midian. They also killed Balaam son of Beor with the sword.
</p>

<p>
<a id="31-9"></a> <b>9</b> The Israelites captured the Midianite women and their children, and they plundered all their herds, flocks, and goods. 
<a id="31-10"></a> <b>10</b> Then they burned all the cities where the Midianites had lived, as well as all their encampments, 
<a id="31-11"></a> <b>11</b> and carried away all the plunder and spoils, both people and animals.
</p>

<p>
<a id="31-12"></a> <b>12</b> They brought the captives, spoils, and plunder to Moses, to Eleazar the priest, and to the congregation of Israel at the camp on the plains of Moab, by the Jordan across from Jericho. 
<a id="31-13"></a> <b>13</b> And Moses, Eleazar the priest, and all the leaders of the congregation went to meet them outside the camp.
</p>

<p>
<a id="31-14"></a> <b>14</b> But Moses was angry with the officers of the army&#x2014;the commanders of thousands and commanders of hundreds&#x2014;who were returning from the battle.
<a id="31-15"></a> <b>15</b> “Have you spared all the women?” he asked them.
<a id="31-16"></a> <b>16</b> “Look, these women caused the sons of Israel, through the counsel of Balaam, to turn unfaithfully against the LORD at Peor, so that the plague struck the congregation of the LORD. 
<a id="31-17"></a> <b>17</b> So now, kill all the boys, as well as every woman who has had relations with a man, 
<a id="31-18"></a> <b>18</b> but spare for yourselves every girl who has never had relations with a man.
</p>

<p>
<a id="31-19"></a> <b>19</b> All of you who have killed a person or touched the dead are to remain outside the camp for seven days. On the third day and the seventh day you are to purify both yourselves and your captives. 
<a id="31-20"></a> <b>20</b> And purify every garment and leather good, everything made of goat&rsquo;s hair, and every article of wood.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="31-21"></a> <b>21</b> Then Eleazar the priest said to the soldiers who had gone into battle, “This is the statute of the law which the LORD has commanded Moses: 
<a id="31-22"></a> <b>22</b> Only the gold, silver, bronze, iron, tin, and lead&#x2014; 
<a id="31-23"></a> <b>23</b> everything that can withstand the fire&#x2014;must be put through the fire, and it will be clean. But it must still be purified with the water of purification. And everything that cannot withstand the fire must pass through the water.

<p>
<a id="31-41"></a> <b>41</b> Moses gave the tribute to Eleazar the priest as an offering for the LORD, as the LORD had commanded Moses.

<a id="32-1"></a> Now the Reubenites and Gadites, who had very large herds and flocks, surveyed the lands of Jazer and Gilead, and they saw that the region was suitable for livestock. 
<a id="32-2"></a> <b>2</b> So the Gadites and Reubenites came to Moses, Eleazar the priest, and the leaders of the congregation, and said,
<a id="32-3"></a> <b>3</b> “Ataroth, Dibon, Jazer, Nimrah, Heshbon, Elealeh, Sebam, Nebo, and Beon, 
<a id="32-4"></a> <b>4</b> which the LORD conquered before the congregation of Israel, are suitable for livestock&#x2014;and your servants have livestock.”
<a id="32-5"></a> <b>5</b> “If we have found favor in your sight,” they said, “let this land be given to your servants as a possession. Do not make us cross the Jordan.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="32-6"></a> <b>6</b> But Moses asked the Gadites and Reubenites, “Shall your brothers go to war while you sit here? 
<a id="32-7"></a> <b>7</b> Why are you discouraging the Israelites from crossing into the land that the LORD has given them? 
<a id="32-8"></a> <b>8</b> This is what your fathers did when I sent them from Kadesh-barnea to inspect the land.
</p>

<p>
<a id="32-9"></a> <b>9</b> For when your fathers went up to the Valley of Eshcol and saw the land, they discouraged the Israelites from entering the land that the LORD had given them. 
<a id="32-10"></a> <b>10</b> So the anger of the LORD was kindled that day, and He swore an oath, saying, 11‘Because they did not follow Me wholeheartedly, not one of the men twenty years of age or older who came out of Egypt will see the land that I swore to give Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob&#x2014; 
<a id="32-12"></a> <b>12</b> not one except Caleb son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite and Joshua son of Nun&#x2014;because they did follow the LORD wholeheartedly.&rsquo; 
<a id="32-13"></a> <b>13</b> The anger of the LORD burned against Israel, and He made them wander in the wilderness forty years, until the whole generation who had done evil in His sight was gone.
</p>

<p>
<a id="32-14"></a> <b>14</b> Now behold, you, a brood of sinners, have risen up in place of your fathers to further stoke the burning anger of the LORD against Israel. 
<a id="32-15"></a> <b>15</b> For if you turn away from following Him, He will once again leave this people in the wilderness, and you will be the cause of their destruction.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="32-16"></a> <b>16</b> Then the Gadites and Reubenites approached Moses and said, “We want to build sheepfolds here for our livestock and cities for our little ones. 
<a id="32-17"></a> <b>17</b> But we will arm ourselves and be ready to go ahead of the Israelites until we have brought them into their place. Meanwhile, our little ones will remain in the fortified cities for protection from the inhabitants of the land. 
<a id="32-18"></a> <b>18</b> We will not return to our homes until every Israelite has taken possession of his inheritance. 
<a id="32-19"></a> <b>19</b> Yet we will not have an inheritance with them across the Jordan and beyond, because our inheritance has come to us on the east side of the Jordan.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="32-20"></a> <b>20</b> Moses replied, “If you will do this&#x2014;if you will arm yourselves before the LORD for battle, 
<a id="32-21"></a> <b>21</b> and if every one of your armed men crosses the Jordan before the LORD, until He has driven His enemies out before Him, 
<a id="32-22"></a> <b>22</b> then when the land is subdued before the LORD, you may return and be free of obligation to the LORD and to Israel. And this land will belong to you as a possession before the LORD. 
<a id="32-23"></a> <b>23</b> But if you do not do this, you will certainly sin against the LORD&#x2014;and be assured that your sin will find you out. 
<a id="32-24"></a> <b>24</b> Build cities for your little ones and folds for your flocks, but do what you have promised.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="32-25"></a> <b>25</b> The Gadites and Reubenites said to Moses, “Your servants will do just as our lord commands. 
<a id="32-26"></a> <b>26</b> Our children, our wives, our livestock, and all our animals will remain here in the cities of Gilead. 
<a id="32-27"></a> <b>27</b> But your servants are equipped for war, and every man will cross over to the battle before the LORD, just as our lord says.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="32-28"></a> <b>28</b> So Moses gave orders about them to Eleazar the priest, to Joshua son of Nun, and to the family leaders of the tribes of Israel. 
<a id="32-29"></a> <b>29</b> And Moses said to them, “If the Gadites and Reubenites cross the Jordan with you, with every man armed for battle before the LORD, and the land is subdued before you, then you are to give them the land of Gilead as a possession. 
<a id="32-30"></a> <b>30</b> But if they do not arm themselves and go across with you, then they must accept their possession among you in the land of Canaan.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="32-31"></a> <b>31</b> The Gadites and Reubenites replied, “As the LORD has spoken to your servants, so we will do. 
<a id="32-32"></a> <b>32</b> We will cross over into the land of Canaan armed before the LORD, that we may have our inheritance on this side of the Jordan.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="32-33"></a> <b>33</b> So Moses gave to the Gadites, to the Reubenites, and to the half-tribe of Manasseh son of Joseph the kingdom of Sihon king of the Amorites and the kingdom of Og king of Bashan&#x2014;the land including its cities and the territory surrounding them.
</p>

<p>
<a id="32-34"></a> <b>34</b> And the Gadites built up Dibon, Ataroth, Aroer, 
<a id="32-35"></a> <b>35</b> Atroth-shophan, Jazer, Jogbehah, 
<a id="32-36"></a> <b>36</b> Beth-nimrah, and Beth-haran as fortified cities, and they built folds for their flocks.
</p>

<p>
<a id="32-37"></a> <b>37</b> The Reubenites built up Heshbon, Elealeh, Kiriathaim, 
<a id="32-38"></a> <b>38</b> as well as Nebo and Baal-meon (whose names were changed), and Sibmah. And they renamed the cities they rebuilt.
</p>

<p>
<a id="32-39"></a> <b>39</b> The descendants of Machir son of Manasseh went to Gilead, captured it, and drove out the Amorites who were there. 
<a id="32-40"></a> <b>40</b> So Moses gave Gilead to the clan of Machir son of Manasseh, and they settled there. 
<a id="32-41"></a> <b>41</b> Jair, a descendant of Manasseh, went and captured their villages and called them Havvoth-jair. 
<a id="32-42"></a> <b>42</b> And Nobah went and captured Kenath and its villages and called it Nobah, after his own name.

<a id="33-2"></a> <b>2</b> At the LORD&rsquo;s command, Moses recorded the stages of their journey. These are the stages listed by their starting points:
</p>

<p>
<a id="33-3"></a> <b>3</b> On the fifteenth day of the first month, on the day after the Passover, the Israelites set out from Rameses. They marched out defiantly in full view of all the Egyptians, 
<a id="33-4"></a> <b>4</b> who were burying all their firstborn, whom the LORD had struck down among them; for the LORD had executed judgment against their gods. 
<a id="33-5"></a> <b>5</b> The Israelites set out from Rameses and camped at Succoth.
</p>

<p>
<a id="33-6"></a> <b>6</b> They set out from Succoth and camped at Etham, on the edge of the wilderness.
</p>

</p>

<p>
<a id="33-9"></a> <b>9</b> They set out from Marah and came to Elim, where there were twelve springs and seventy palm trees, and they camped there.

<p>
<a id="33-10"></a> <b>10</b> They set out from Elim and camped by the Red Sea.
</p>

<p>

<a id="33-36"></a> <b>36</b> They set out from Ezion-geber and camped at Kadesh in the Wilderness of Zin.
</p>

<p>
<a id="33-37"></a> <b>37</b> They set out from Kadesh and camped at Mount Hor, on the outskirts of the land of Edom. 
<a id="33-38"></a> <b>38</b> At the LORD&rsquo;s command, Aaron the priest climbed Mount Hor and died there on the first day of the fifth month, in the fortieth year after the Israelites had come out of the land of Egypt. 
<a id="33-39"></a> <b>39</b> Aaron was 123 years old when he died on Mount Hor.
</p>

<p>
<a id="33-40"></a> <b>40</b> Now the Canaanite king of Arad, who lived in the Negev in the land of Canaan, heard that the Israelites were coming. 
<a id="33-41"></a> <b>41</b> And the Israelites set out from Mount Hor and camped at Zalmonah.

</p>

<p>
<a id="33-45"></a> <b>45</b> They set out from Iyim and camped at Dibon-gad.
</p>

<p>
<a id="33-46"></a> <b>46</b> They set out from Dibon-gad and camped at Almon-diblathaim.
</p>

<p>
<a id="33-47"></a> <b>47</b> They set out from Almon-diblathaim and camped in the mountains of Abarim facing Nebo.

<p>
<a id="33-48"></a> <b>48</b> They set out from the mountains of Abarim and camped on the plains of Moab by the Jordan across from Jericho.

<a id="33-50"></a> <b>50</b> On the plains of Moab by the Jordan across from Jericho, the LORD said to Moses,
<a id="33-51"></a> <b>51</b> “Speak to the Israelites and tell them: When you cross the Jordan into the land of Canaan, 
<a id="33-52"></a> <b>52</b> you must drive out before you all the inhabitants of the land, destroy all their carved images and cast idols, and demolish all their high places.

<p>
<a id="33-53"></a> <b>53</b> You are to take possession of the land and settle in it, for I have given you the land to possess. 
<a id="33-54"></a> <b>54</b> And you are to divide the land by lot according to your clans. Give a larger inheritance to a larger clan and a smaller inheritance to a smaller one. Whatever falls to each one by lot will be his. You will receive an inheritance according to the tribes of your fathers.
</p>

<p>
<a id="33-55"></a> <b>55</b> But if you do not drive out the inhabitants of the land before you, those you allow to remain will become barbs in your eyes and thorns in your sides; they will harass you in the land where you settle.

</p>

<p>
<a id="34-3"></a> <b>3</b> Your southern border will extend from the Wilderness of Zin along the border of Edom. On the east, your southern border will run from the end of the Salt Sea, 
<a id="34-4"></a> <b>4</b> cross south of the Ascent of Akrabbim, continue to Zin, and go south of Kadesh-barnea. Then it will go on to Hazar-addar and proceed to Azmon, 
<a id="34-5"></a> <b>5</b> where it will turn from Azmon, join the Brook of Egypt, and end at the Sea.
</p>

<p>
<a id="34-6"></a> <b>6</b> Your western border will be the coastline of the Great Sea; this will be your boundary on the west.
</p>

<p>
<a id="34-7"></a> <b>7</b> Your northern border will run from the Great Sea directly to Mount Hor, 
<a id="34-8"></a> <b>8</b> and from Mount Hor to Lebo-hamath, then extend to Zedad, 
<a id="34-9"></a> <b>9</b> continue to Ziphron, and end at Hazar-enan. This will be your boundary on the north.
</p>

<p>
<a id="34-10"></a> <b>10</b> And your eastern border will run straight from Hazar-enan to Shepham, 
<a id="34-11"></a> <b>11</b> then go down from Shepham to Riblah on the east side of Ain and continue along the slopes east of the Sea of Chinnereth. 
<a id="34-12"></a> <b>12</b> Then the border will go down along the Jordan and end at the Salt Sea.
This will be your land, defined by its borders on all sides.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="34-13"></a> <b>13</b> So Moses commanded the Israelites, “Apportion this land by lot as an inheritance. The LORD has commanded that it be given to the nine and a half tribes. 
<a id="34-14"></a> <b>14</b> For the tribes of the Reubenites and Gadites, along with the half-tribe of Manasseh, have already received their inheritance.

<a id="35-3"></a> <b>3</b> The cities will be for them to live in, and the pasturelands will be for their herds, their flocks, and all their other livestock.

</p>

<p>
<a id="35-6"></a> <b>6</b> Six of the cities you give the Levites are to be appointed as cities of refuge, to which a manslayer may flee. In addition to these, give the Levites forty-two other cities.

<p>
<a id="35-9"></a> <b>9</b> Then the LORD said to Moses,
<a id="35-10"></a> <b>10</b> “Speak to the Israelites and tell them: When you cross the Jordan into the land of Canaan, 
<a id="35-11"></a> <b>11</b> designate cities to serve as your cities of refuge, so that a person who kills someone unintentionally may flee there. 
<a id="35-12"></a> <b>12</b> You are to have these cities as a refuge from the avenger, so that the manslayer will not die until he stands trial before the assembly.
</p>

<p>
<a id="35-13"></a> <b>13</b> The cities you select will be your six cities of refuge. 
<a id="35-14"></a> <b>14</b> Select three cities across the Jordan and three in the land of Canaan as cities of refuge. 
<a id="35-15"></a> <b>15</b> These six cities will serve as a refuge for the Israelites and for the foreigner or stranger among them, so that anyone who kills a person unintentionally may flee there.
</p>

<p>
<a id="35-16"></a> <b>16</b> If, however, anyone strikes a person with an iron object and kills him, he is a murderer; the murderer must surely be put to death. 
<a id="35-17"></a> <b>17</b> Or if anyone has in his hand a stone of deadly size, and he strikes and kills another, he is a murderer; the murderer must surely be put to death. 
<a id="35-18"></a> <b>18</b> If anyone has in his hand a deadly object of wood, and he strikes and kills another, he is a murderer; the murderer must surely be put to death.
</p>

<p>
<a id="35-19"></a> <b>19</b> The avenger of blood is to put the murderer to death; when he finds him, he is to kill him.
</p>

<p>
<a id="35-20"></a> <b>20</b> Likewise, if anyone maliciously pushes another or intentionally throws an object at him and kills him, 
<a id="35-21"></a> <b>21</b> or if in hostility he strikes him with his hand and he dies, the one who struck him must surely be put to death; he is a murderer. When the avenger of blood finds the murderer, he is to kill him.
</p>

<p>
<a id="35-22"></a> <b>22</b> But if anyone pushes a person suddenly, without hostility, or throws an object at him unintentionally, 
<a id="35-23"></a> <b>23</b> or without looking drops a heavy stone that kills him, but he was not an enemy and did not intend to harm him, 
<a id="35-24"></a> <b>24</b> then the congregation must judge between the slayer and the avenger of blood according to these ordinances. 
<a id="35-25"></a> <b>25</b> The assembly is to protect the manslayer from the hand of the avenger of blood. Then the assembly will return him to the city of refuge to which he fled, and he must live there until the death of the high priest, who was anointed with the holy oil.
</p>

<p>
<a id="35-26"></a> <b>26</b> But if the manslayer ever goes outside the limits of the city of refuge to which he fled 
<a id="35-27"></a> <b>27</b> and the avenger of blood finds him outside of his city of refuge and kills him, then the avenger will not be guilty of bloodshed 
<a id="35-28"></a> <b>28</b> because the manslayer must remain in his city of refuge until the death of the high priest. Only after the death of the high priest may he return to the land he owns. 
<a id="35-29"></a> <b>29</b> This will be a statutory ordinance for you for the generations to come, wherever you live.
</p>

<p>
<a id="35-30"></a> <b>30</b> If anyone kills a person, the murderer is to be put to death on the testimony of the witnesses. But no one is to be put to death based on the testimony of a lone witness.
</p>

<p>
<a id="35-31"></a> <b>31</b> You are not to accept a ransom for the life of a murderer who deserves to die; he must surely be put to death. 
<a id="35-32"></a> <b>32</b> Nor should you accept a ransom for the person who flees to a city of refuge and allow him to return and live on his own land before the death of the high priest.
</p>

<p>
<a id="35-33"></a> <b>33</b> Do not pollute the land where you live, for bloodshed pollutes the land, and no atonement can be made for the land on which the blood is shed, except by the blood of the one who shed it.

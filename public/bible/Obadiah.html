<a id="1-1"></a> This is the vision of Obadiah:
</p>

<p>
This is what the Lord GOD says about Edom&#x2014;
</p>

<p>
We have heard a message from the LORD;
</p>

<p>
an envoy has been sent among the nations
</p>

<p>
to say, “Rise up,
</p>

<p>
and let us go to battle against her!”&#x2014;
</p>

<p>
<a id="1-2"></a> <b>2</b> “Behold, I will make you small among the nations;
</p>

<p>
you will be deeply despised.
</p>

<p>
<a id="1-3"></a> <b>3</b> The pride of your heart has deceived you,
</p>

<p>
O dwellers in the clefts of the rocks
</p>

<p>
whose habitation is the heights,
</p>

<p>
who say in your heart,
</p>

<p>
‘Who can bring me down to the ground?&rsquo;
</p>

<p>
<a id="1-4"></a> <b>4</b> Though you soar like the eagle
</p>

<p>
and make your nest among the stars,
</p>

<p>
even from there I will bring you down,”
</p>

<p>
declares the LORD.
</p>

<p>
<a id="1-5"></a> <b>5</b> “If thieves came to you,
</p>

<p>
if robbers by night&#x2014;
</p>

<p>
oh, how you will be ruined&#x2014;
</p>

<p>
would they not steal only what they wanted?
</p>

<p>
If grape gatherers came to you,
</p>

<p>
would they not leave some gleanings?
</p>

<p>
<a id="1-6"></a> <b>6</b> But how Esau will be pillaged,
</p>

<p>
his hidden treasures sought out!
</p>

<p>
<a id="1-7"></a> <b>7</b> All the men allied with you
</p>

<p>
will drive you to the border;
</p>

<p>
the men at peace with you
</p>

<p>
will deceive and overpower you.
</p>

<p>
Those who eat your bread
</p>

<p>
will set a trap for you
</p>

<p>
without your awareness of it.
</p>

<p>
<a id="1-8"></a> <b>8</b> In that day, declares the LORD,
</p>

<p>
will I not destroy the wise men of Edom
</p>

<p>
and the men of understanding
</p>

<p>
in the mountains of Esau?
</p>

<p>
<a id="1-9"></a> <b>9</b> Then your mighty men, O Teman,
</p>

<p>
will be terrified,
</p>

<p>
so that everyone in the mountains of Esau
</p>

<p>
will be cut down in the slaughter.
</p>

<p>
<a id="1-10"></a> <b>10</b> Because of the violence against your brother Jacob,
</p>

<p>
you will be covered with shame
</p>

<p>
and cut off forever.
</p>

<p>
<a id="1-11"></a> <b>11</b> On the day you stood aloof
</p>

<p>
while strangers carried off his wealth
</p>

<p>
and foreigners entered his gate
</p>

<p>
and cast lots for Jerusalem,
</p>

<p>
you were just like one of them.
</p>

<p>
<a id="1-12"></a> <b>12</b> But you should not gloat in that day,
</p>

<p>
your brother&rsquo;s day of misfortune,
</p>

<p>
nor rejoice over the people of Judah
</p>

<p>
in the day of their destruction,
</p>

<p>
nor boast proudly
</p>

<p>
in the day of their distress.
</p>

<p>
<a id="1-13"></a> <b>13</b> You should not enter the gate of My people
</p>

<p>
in the day of their disaster,
</p>

<p>
nor gloat over their affliction
</p>

<p>
in the day of their disaster,
</p>

<p>
nor loot their wealth
</p>

<p>
in the day of their disaster.
</p>

<p>
<a id="1-14"></a> <b>14</b> Nor should you stand at the crossroads
</p>

<p>
to cut off their fugitives,
</p>

<p>
nor deliver up their survivors
</p>

<p>
in the day of their distress.

<p>
<a id="1-3"></a> <b>3</b> I thank my God every time I remember you. 
<a id="1-4"></a> <b>4</b> In every prayer for all of you, I always pray with joy, 
<a id="1-5"></a> <b>5</b> because of your partnership in the gospel from the first day until now, 
<a id="1-6"></a> <b>6</b> being confident of this, that He who began a good work in you will carry it on to completion until the day of Christ Jesus.
</p>

<p>
<a id="1-7"></a> <b>7</b> It is right for me to feel this way about all of you, since I have you in my heart. For in my chains and in my defense and confirmation of the gospel, you are all partners in grace with me. 
<a id="1-8"></a> <b>8</b> God is my witness how I long for all of you with the affection of Christ Jesus.
</p>

<p>
<a id="1-9"></a> <b>9</b> And this is my prayer: that your love may abound more and more in knowledge and depth of insight, 
<a id="1-10"></a> <b>10</b> so that you may be able to test and prove what is best and may be pure and blameless for the day of Christ, 
<a id="1-11"></a> <b>11</b> filled with the fruit of righteousness that comes through Jesus Christ, to the glory and praise of God.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgc90890f">
<p>
<a id="1-12"></a> <b>12</b> Now I want you to know, brothers, that my circumstances have actually served to advance the gospel. 
<a id="1-13"></a> <b>13</b> As a result, it has become clear throughout the whole palace guard and to everyone else that I am in chains for Christ. 
<a id="1-14"></a> <b>14</b> And most of the brothers, confident in the Lord by my chains, now dare more greatly to speak the word without fear.
</p>

<p>
<a id="1-15"></a> <b>15</b> It is true that some preach Christ out of envy and rivalry, but others out of goodwill. 
<a id="1-16"></a> <b>16</b> The latter do so in love, knowing that I am appointed for the defense of the gospel. 
<a id="1-17"></a> <b>17</b> The former, however, preach Christ out of selfish ambition, not sincerely, supposing that they can add to the distress of my chains.
</p>

<p>
<a id="1-18"></a> <b>18</b> What then is the issue? Just this: that in every way, whether by false motives or true, Christ is preached. And in this I rejoice. Yes, and I will continue to rejoice, 
<a id="1-19"></a> <b>19</b> because I know that through your prayers and the provision of the Spirit of Jesus Christ, my distress will turn out for my deliverance. 
<a id="1-20"></a> <b>20</b> I eagerly expect and hope that I will in no way be ashamed, but will have complete boldness so that now as always Christ will be exalted in my body, whether by life or by death.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org89d15f8">
<p>
<a id="1-21"></a> <b>21</b> For to me, to live is Christ, and to die is gain. 
<a id="1-22"></a> <b>22</b> But if I go on living in the body, this will mean fruitful labor for me. So what shall I choose? I do not know. 
<a id="1-23"></a> <b>23</b> I am torn between the two. I desire to depart and be with Christ, which is far better indeed. 
<a id="1-24"></a> <b>24</b> But it is more necessary for you that I remain in the body.
</p>

<p>
<a id="1-25"></a> <b>25</b> Convinced of this, I know that I will remain and will continue with all of you for your progress and joy in the faith, 
<a id="1-26"></a> <b>26</b> so that through my coming to you again your exultation in Christ Jesus will resound on account of me.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org3e67e1f">
<p>
<a id="1-27"></a> <b>27</b> Nevertheless, conduct yourselves in a manner worthy of the gospel of Christ. Then, whether I come and see you or only hear about you in my absence, I will know that you stand firm in one spirit, contending side by side for the faith of the gospel, 
<a id="1-28"></a> <b>28</b> without being frightened in any way by those who oppose you. This is a clear sign of their destruction but of your salvation, and it is from God. 
<a id="1-29"></a> <b>29</b> For it has been granted to you on behalf of Christ not only to believe in Him, but also to suffer for Him, 
<a id="1-30"></a> <b>30</b> since you are encountering the same struggle you saw I had, and now hear that I still have.

<a id="2-5"></a> <b>5</b> Let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus:
</p>

<p>
<a id="2-6"></a> <b>6</b> Who, existing in the form of God,
</p>

<p>
did not consider equality with God

<p>

<p>
<a id="2-7"></a> <b>7</b> but emptied Himself,

taking the form of a servant,

He humbled Himself

and became obedient to death&#x2014;

<p>
even death on a cross.

<p>
<a id="2-9"></a> <b>9</b> Therefore God exalted Him to the highest place

<p>
and gave Him the name above all names,

<p>
<a id="2-10"></a> <b>10</b> that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow,

<p>
in heaven and on earth and under the earth,

<a id="2-12"></a> <b>12</b> Therefore, my beloved, just as you have always obeyed, not only in my presence, but now even more in my absence, continue to work out your salvation with fear and trembling. 
<a id="2-13"></a> <b>13</b> For it is God who works in you to will and to act on behalf of His good purpose.
</p>

<p>
<a id="2-14"></a> <b>14</b> Do everything without complaining or arguing, 
<a id="2-15"></a> <b>15</b> so that you may be blameless and pure, children of God without fault in a crooked and perverse generation, in which you shine as lights in the world 
<a id="2-16"></a> <b>16</b> as you hold forth the word of life, in order that I may boast on the day of Christ that I did not run or labor in vain.
</p>

<p>
<a id="2-17"></a> <b>17</b> But even if I am being poured out like a drink offering on the sacrifice and service of your faith, I am glad and rejoice with all of you.

<p>
<a id="2-19"></a> <b>19</b> Now I hope in the Lord Jesus to send Timothy to you soon, that I also may be cheered when I learn how you are doing. 
<a id="2-20"></a> <b>20</b> I have nobody else like him who will genuinely care for your needs. 
<a id="2-21"></a> <b>21</b> For all the others look after their own interests, not those of Jesus Christ. 
<a id="2-22"></a> <b>22</b> But you know Timothy&rsquo;s proven worth, that as a child with his father he has served with me to advance the gospel. 
<a id="2-23"></a> <b>23</b> So I hope to send him as soon as I see what happens with me. 
<a id="2-24"></a> <b>24</b> And I trust in the Lord that I myself will come soon.
</p>

<p>
<a id="2-25"></a> <b>25</b> But I thought it necessary to send back to you Epaphroditus, my brother, fellow worker, and fellow soldier, who is also your messenger and minister to my needs. 
<a id="2-26"></a> <b>26</b> For he has been longing for all of you and is distressed because you heard he was ill. 
<a id="2-27"></a> <b>27</b> He was sick indeed, nearly unto death. But God had mercy on him, and not only on him but also on me, to spare me sorrow upon sorrow.
</p>

<p>
<a id="2-28"></a> <b>28</b> Therefore I am all the more eager to send him, so that when you see him again you may rejoice, and I may be less anxious. 
<a id="2-29"></a> <b>29</b> Welcome him in the Lord with great joy, and honor men like him, 
<a id="2-30"></a> <b>30</b> because he nearly died for the work of Christ, risking his life to make up for your deficit of service to me.

<a id="3-1"></a> Finally, my brothers, rejoice in the Lord. It is no trouble for me to write the same things to you again, and it is a safeguard for you.
</p>

<p>
<a id="3-2"></a> <b>2</b> Watch out for those dogs, those workers of evil, those mutilators of the flesh! 
<a id="3-3"></a> <b>3</b> For it is we who are the circumcision, we who worship by the Spirit of God, who glory in Christ Jesus, and who put no confidence in the flesh&#x2014; 
<a id="3-4"></a> <b>4</b> though I myself could have such confidence.
</p>

<p>
If anyone else thinks he has grounds for confidence in the flesh, I have more: 
<a id="3-5"></a> <b>5</b> circumcised on the eighth day, of the people of Israel, of the tribe of Benjamin; a Hebrew of Hebrews; as to the law, a Pharisee; 
<a id="3-6"></a> <b>6</b> as to zeal, persecuting the church; as to righteousness in the law, faultless.
</p>

<p>
<a id="3-7"></a> <b>7</b> But whatever was gain to me I count as loss for the sake of Christ. 
<a id="3-8"></a> <b>8</b> More than that, I count all things as loss compared to the surpassing excellence of knowing Christ Jesus my Lord, for whom I have lost all things. I consider them rubbish, that I may gain Christ 
<a id="3-9"></a> <b>9</b> and be found in Him, not having my own righteousness from the law, but that which is through faith in Christ, the righteousness from God on the basis of faith.
</p>

<p>
<a id="3-10"></a> <b>10</b> I want to know Christ and the power of His resurrection and the fellowship of His sufferings, being conformed to Him in His death, 
<a id="3-11"></a> <b>11</b> and so, somehow, to attain to the resurrection from the dead.
</p>

<p>
Pressing on toward the Goal
</p>

<p>
<a id="3-12"></a> <b>12</b> Not that I have already obtained all this, or have already been made perfect, but I press on to take hold of that for which Christ Jesus took hold of me. 
<a id="3-13"></a> <b>13</b> Brothers, I do not consider myself yet to have taken hold of it. But one thing I do: Forgetting what is behind and straining toward what is ahead, 
<a id="3-14"></a> <b>14</b> I press on toward the goal to win the prize of God&rsquo;s heavenly calling in Christ Jesus.
</p>

<p>
<a id="3-15"></a> <b>15</b> All of us who are mature should embrace this point of view. And if you think differently about some issue, God will reveal this to you as well. 
<a id="3-16"></a> <b>16</b> Nevertheless, we must live up to what we have already attained.

<a id="3-18"></a> <b>18</b> For as I have often told you before, and now say again even with tears: Many live as enemies of the cross of Christ. 
<a id="3-19"></a> <b>19</b> Their end is destruction, their god is their belly, and their glory is in their shame. Their minds are set on earthly things.

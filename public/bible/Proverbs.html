<a id="1-1"></a> These are the proverbs of Solomon son of David,
</p>

<p>
king of Israel,
</p>

<p>
<a id="1-2"></a> <b>2</b> for gaining wisdom and discipline,
</p>

<p>
for comprehending words of insight,
</p>

<p>
<a id="1-3"></a> <b>3</b> and for receiving instruction in wise living
</p>

<p>
and in righteousness, justice, and equity.
</p>

<p>
<a id="1-4"></a> <b>4</b> To impart prudence to the simple
</p>

<p>
and knowledge and discretion to the young,
</p>

<p>
<a id="1-5"></a> <b>5</b> let the wise listen and gain instruction,
</p>

<p>
and the discerning acquire wise counsel
</p>

<p>
<a id="1-6"></a> <b>6</b> by understanding the proverbs and parables,
</p>

<p>
the sayings and riddles of the wise.
</p>

<p>
<a id="1-7"></a> <b>7</b> The fear of the LORD is the beginning of knowledge,
</p>

<p>
but fools despise wisdom and discipline.
</p>

<p>
The Enticement of Sin
</p>

<p>
<a id="1-8"></a> <b>8</b> Listen, my son, to your father&rsquo;s instruction,
</p>

<p>
and do not forsake the teaching of your mother.
</p>

<p>
<a id="1-9"></a> <b>9</b> For they are a garland of grace on your head
</p>

<p>
and a pendant around your neck.
</p>

<p>
<a id="1-10"></a> <b>10</b> My son, if sinners entice you,
</p>

<p>
do not yield to them.
</p>

<p>
<a id="1-11"></a> <b>11</b> If they say, “Come along, let us lie in wait for blood,
</p>

<p>
let us ambush the innocent without cause,
</p>

<p>
<a id="1-12"></a> <b>12</b> let us swallow them alive like Sheol,
</p>

<p>
and whole like those descending into the Pit.
</p>

<p>
<a id="1-13"></a> <b>13</b> We will find all manner of precious goods;

<p>
we will fill our houses with plunder.

<p>
<a id="1-14"></a> <b>14</b> Throw in your lot with us;

<p>
or set foot upon their path.
</p>

<p>
<a id="1-16"></a> <b>16</b> For their feet run to evil,
</p>

<p>
and they are swift to shed blood.
</p>

<p>
<a id="1-17"></a> <b>17</b> How futile it is to spread the net
</p>

<p>
where any bird can see it!
</p>

<p>
<a id="1-18"></a> <b>18</b> But they lie in wait for their own blood;
</p>

<p>
they ambush their own lives.
</p>

<p>
<a id="1-19"></a> <b>19</b> Such is the fate of all who are greedy,
</p>

<p>
whose unjust gain takes the lives of its possessors.

<a id="1-20"></a> <b>20</b> Wisdom calls out in the street,

<p>
she lifts her voice in the square;
</p>

<p>
<a id="1-21"></a> <b>21</b> in the main concourse she cries aloud,
</p>

at the city gates she makes her speech:
</p>

<a id="1-22"></a> <b>22</b> “How long, O simple ones, will you love your simple ways?

<p>
How long will scoffers delight in their scorn

and fools hate knowledge?

<p>
<a id="1-23"></a> <b>23</b> If you had repented at my rebuke,

then surely I would have poured out my spirit on you;

I would have made my words known to you.

<p>
<a id="1-24"></a> <b>24</b> Because you refused my call,
</p>

<p>
and no one took my outstretched hand,

<p>
<a id="1-25"></a> <b>25</b> because you neglected all my counsel,
</p>

<p>
and wanted none of my correction,
</p>

<p>
<a id="1-26"></a> <b>26</b> in turn I will mock your calamity;
</p>

<p>
I will sneer when terror strikes you,
</p>

<p>
<a id="1-27"></a> <b>27</b> when your dread comes like a storm,
</p>

<p>
and your destruction like a whirlwind,
</p>

<p>
when distress and anguish overwhelm you.
</p>

<p>
<a id="1-28"></a> <b>28</b> Then they will call on me, but I will not answer;
</p>

<p>
they will earnestly seek me, but will not find me.
</p>

<p>
<a id="1-29"></a> <b>29</b> For they hated knowledge
</p>

<p>
and chose not to fear the LORD.
</p>

<p>
<a id="1-30"></a> <b>30</b> They accepted none of my counsel;
</p>

<p>
they despised all my reproof.
</p>

<p>
<a id="1-31"></a> <b>31</b> So they will eat the fruit of their own way,
</p>

<p>
and be filled with their own devices.
</p>

<p>
<a id="1-32"></a> <b>32</b> For the waywardness of the simple will slay them,

<p>
and the complacency of fools will destroy them.

secure from the fear of evil.”

<p>
<a id="29-21"></a> <b>21</b> A servant pampered from his youth
</p>

<p>
will bring grief in the end.
</p>

<p>
<a id="29-22"></a> <b>22</b> An angry man stirs up dissension,

<p>
and a hot-tempered man abounds in transgression.
</p>

<p>
<a id="29-23"></a> <b>23</b> A man&rsquo;s pride will bring him low,
</p>

<p>
but a humble spirit will obtain honor.

<p>
<a id="29-24"></a> <b>24</b> A partner to a thief hates his own soul;
</p>

<p>
he receives the oath, but does not testify.
</p>

<p>
<a id="29-25"></a> <b>25</b> The fear of man is a snare,
</p>

but whoever trusts in the LORD is set securely on high.
</p>

<p>
<a id="29-26"></a> <b>26</b> Many seek the ruler&rsquo;s favor,

<p>
but a man receives justice from the LORD.
</p>

<p>
<a id="29-27"></a> <b>27</b> An unjust man is detestable to the righteous,
</p>

<p>
and one whose way is upright is detestable to the wicked.

<a id="30-1"></a> These are the words of Agur son of Jakeh&#x2014;the burden that this man declared to Ithiel:
</p>

<p>
“I am weary, O God,
</p>

<p>
and worn out.
</p>

<p>
<a id="30-2"></a> <b>2</b> Surely I am the most ignorant of men,
</p>

<p>
and I lack the understanding of a man.
</p>

<p>
<a id="30-3"></a> <b>3</b> I have not learned wisdom,

<p>
<a id="30-4"></a> <b>4</b> Who has ascended to heaven and come down?

Who has bound up the waters in His cloak?

Who has established all the ends of the earth?

What is His name, and what is the name of His Son&#x2014;
</p>

<p>
surely you know!
</p>

<p>
<a id="30-5"></a> <b>5</b> Every word of God is flawless;
</p>

<p>
He is a shield to those who take refuge in Him.
</p>

<p>
<a id="30-6"></a> <b>6</b> Do not add to His words,
</p>

<p>
lest He rebuke you and prove you a liar.
</p>

<p>
<a id="30-7"></a> <b>7</b> Two things I ask of You&#x2014;
</p>

<p>
do not refuse me before I die:
</p>

<p>
<a id="30-8"></a> <b>8</b> Keep falsehood and deceitful words far from me.

<p>
Give me neither poverty nor riches;
</p>

<p>
feed me with the bread that is my portion.
</p>

<p>
<a id="30-9"></a> <b>9</b> Otherwise, I may have too much
</p>

<p>
and deny You, saying, ‘Who is the LORD?&rsquo;
</p>

<p>
Or I may become poor and steal,
</p>

<p>
profaning the name of my God.
</p>

<p>
<a id="30-10"></a> <b>10</b> Do not slander a servant to his master,
</p>

<p>
or he will curse you, and you will bear the guilt.
</p>

<p>
<a id="30-11"></a> <b>11</b> There is a generation of those who curse their fathers

and yet unwashed of their filth.

<p>
<a id="30-13"></a> <b>13</b> There is a generation&#x2014;how haughty are their eyes

<p>
and pretentious are their glances&#x2014;
</p>

<p>
<a id="30-14"></a> <b>14</b> there is a generation whose teeth are swords

<a id="30-15"></a> <b>15</b> The leech has two daughters:

There are three things that are never satisfied, four that never say, ‘Enough!&rsquo;:

<p>
<a id="30-16"></a> <b>16</b> Sheol,
</p>

<p>
the barren womb,
</p>

<p>
land never satisfied with water,
</p>

<p>
and fire that never says, ‘Enough!&rsquo;
</p>

<p>
<a id="30-17"></a> <b>17</b> As for the eye that mocks a father

<p>
and scorns obedience to a mother,

<p>
may the ravens of the valley pluck it out
</p>

<p>
and young vultures devour it.
</p>

<p>
<a id="30-18"></a> <b>18</b> There are three things too wonderful for me, four that I cannot understand:

<p>
<a id="30-19"></a> <b>19</b> the way of an eagle in the sky,
</p>

<p>
the way of a snake on a rock,

the way of a ship at sea,

and the way of a man with a maiden.

<p>
<a id="30-20"></a> <b>20</b> This is the way of an adulteress:

She eats and wipes her mouth

<p>
<a id="30-21"></a> <b>21</b> Under three things the earth trembles, under four it cannot bear up:
</p>

<p>
<a id="30-22"></a> <b>22</b> a servant who becomes king,

<p>
a fool who is filled with food,
</p>

<p>
<a id="30-23"></a> <b>23</b> an unloved woman who marries,
</p>

<p>
and a maidservant who supplants her mistress.

<p>
<a id="30-24"></a> <b>24</b> Four things on earth are small, yet they are exceedingly wise:
</p>

<p>
<a id="30-25"></a> <b>25</b> The ants are creatures of little strength, yet they store up their food in the summer;
</p>

<p>
<a id="30-26"></a> <b>26</b> the rock badgers are creatures of little power, yet they make their homes in the rocks;
</p>

<a id="30-27"></a> <b>27</b> the locusts have no king, yet they all advance in formation;
</p>

<p>
<a id="30-28"></a> <b>28</b> and the lizard can be caught in one&rsquo;s hands, yet it is found in the palaces of kings.
</p>

<p>
<a id="30-29"></a> <b>29</b> There are three things that are stately in their stride, and four that are impressive in their walk:
</p>

<p>
<a id="30-30"></a> <b>30</b> a lion, mighty among beasts, refusing to retreat before anything;
</p>

<p>
<a id="30-31"></a> <b>31</b> a strutting rooster;
</p>

<p>
a he-goat;

<p>
and a king with his army around him.

<p>
<a id="30-32"></a> <b>32</b> If you have foolishly exalted yourself

<p>
or if you have plotted evil,

put your hand over your mouth.

so the stirring of anger brings forth strife.”

<p>
<a id="31-2"></a> <b>2</b> What shall I say, O my son?

<p>
What, O son of my womb?

<p>
What, O son of my vows?

<a id="31-4"></a> <b>4</b> It is not for kings, O Lemuel,

it is not for kings to drink wine,

<p>
<a id="31-5"></a> <b>5</b> lest they drink and forget what is decreed,

depriving all the oppressed of justice.

<p>
and wine to the bitter in soul.

<p>
<a id="31-7"></a> <b>7</b> Let him drink and forget his poverty,
</p>

<p>
and remember his misery no more.
</p>

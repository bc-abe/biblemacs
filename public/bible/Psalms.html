<a id="1-1"></a> Blessed is the man <br>
who does not walk in the counsel of the wicked, <br>
or set foot on the path of sinners, <br>
or sit in the seat of mockers.  <br>
<a id="1-2"></a> <b>2</b> But his delight is in the Law of YHWH, <br>
and on His law he meditates day and night.  <br>
<a id="1-3"></a> <b>3</b> He is like a tree planted by streams of water, <br>
yielding its fruit in season, <br>
whose leaf does not wither, <br>
and who prospers in all he does. <br>
<a id="1-4"></a> <b>4</b> Not so the wicked! <br>
For they are like chaff driven off by the wind.  <br>
<a id="1-5"></a> <b>5</b> Therefore the wicked will not stand in the judgment, <br>
nor sinners in the assembly of the righteous. <br>
<a id="1-6"></a> <b>6</b> For YHWH guards the path of the righteous, <br>
but the way of the wicked will perish. <br>

<a id="2-1"></a> Why do the nations rage <br>
and the peoples plot in vain? <br>
<a id="2-2"></a> <b>2</b> The kings of the earth take their stand <br>
and the rulers gather together, <br>
against YHWH <br>
and against His Anointed One: <br>
<a id="2-3"></a> <b>3</b> “Let us break Their chains <br>
and cast away Their cords.” <br>
<a id="2-4"></a> <b>4</b> The One enthroned in heaven laughs; <br>
the Lord taunts them. <br>
<a id="2-5"></a> <b>5</b> Then He rebukes them in His anger, <br>
and terrifies them in His fury: <br>
<a id="2-6"></a> <b>6</b> “I have installed My King on Zion, <br>
upon My holy mountain.” <br>
<a id="2-7"></a> <b>7</b> I will proclaim the decreespoken to Me by YHWH: <br>
“You are My Son; <br>
today I have become Your Father. <br>
<a id="2-8"></a> <b>8</b> Ask Me, and I will make the nations Your inheritance, <br>
the ends of the earth Your possession. <br>
<a id="2-9"></a> <b>9</b> You will break them with an iron scepter; <br>
You will shatter them like pottery.” <br>
<a id="2-10"></a> <b>10</b> Therefore be wise, O kings; <br>
be admonished, O judges of the earth. <br>
<a id="2-11"></a> <b>11</b> Serve YHWH with fear, <br>
and rejoice with trembling. <br>
<a id="2-12"></a> <b>12</b> Kiss the Son, lest He be angry <br>
and you perish in your rebellion, <br>
when His wrath ignites in an instant. <br>
Blessed are all who take refuge in Him.. <br>

destruction lies within them. <br>

My God is my rock, in whom I take refuge, <br>

the snares of death confronted me. <br>
<a id="18-6"></a> <b>6</b> In my distress I called upon YHWH; <br>
I cried to my God for help. <br>
From His temple He heard my voice, <br>
and my cry for His help reached His ears. <br>

and the foundations of the mountains trembled; <br>
they were shaken because He burned with anger. <br>
<a id="18-8"></a> <b>8</b> Smoke rose from His nostrils, <br>
and consuming fire came from His mouth; <br>
glowing coals blazed forth. <br>
<a id="18-9"></a> <b>9</b> He parted the heavens and came down <br>
with dark clouds beneath His feet. <br>
<a id="18-10"></a> <b>10</b> He mounted a cherub and flew; <br>
He soared on the wings of the wind. <br>
<a id="18-11"></a> <b>11</b> He made darkness His hiding place, <br>

<a id="18-12"></a> <b>12</b> From the brightness of His presence <br>

<a id="18-14"></a> <b>14</b> He shot His arrows and scattered the foes; <br>
He hurled lightning and routed them. <br>
<a id="18-15"></a> <b>15</b> The channels of the sea appeared, <br>
and the foundations of the world were exposed, <br>
at Your rebuke, O YHWH, <br>
at the blast of the breath of Your nostrils. <br>
<a id="18-16"></a> <b>16</b> He reached down from on high and took hold of me; <br>
He drew me out of deep waters. <br>
<a id="18-17"></a> <b>17</b> He rescued me from my powerful enemy, <br>
from foes too mighty for me. <br>
<a id="18-18"></a> <b>18</b> They confronted me in my day of calamity, <br>

<a id="18-19"></a> <b>19</b> He brought me out into the open; <br>
He rescued me because He delighted in me. <br>
<a id="18-20"></a> <b>20</b> YHWH has rewarded me according to my righteousness; <br>
He has repaid me according to the cleanness of my hands. <br>

<p>
<a id="18-21"></a> <b>21</b> For I have kept the ways of YHWH <br>
and have not wickedly departed from my God. <br>
<a id="18-22"></a> <b>22</b> For all His ordinances are before me; <br>
I have not disregarded His statutes. <br>
<a id="18-23"></a> And I have been blameless before Him <br>

<a id="18-24"></a> So YHWH has repaid me according to my righteousness, <br>
according to the cleanness of my hands in His sight. <br>
<a id="18-25"></a> To the faithful You show Yourself faithful, <br>
to the blameless You show Yourself blameless; <br>
<a id="18-26"></a> to the pure You show Yourself pure, <br>
but to the crooked You show Yourself shrewd. <br>
<a id="18-27"></a> For You save an afflicted people, <br>
but You humble those with haughty eyes. <br>
<a id="18-28"></a> For You, O YHWH, light my lamp; <br>
my God lights up my darkness. <br>
<a id="18-29"></a> For in You I can charge an army, <br>
and with my God I can scale a wall. <br>
<a id="18-30"></a> As for God, His way is perfect; <br>
the word of YHWH is flawless. <br>
He is a shield to all who take refuge in Him. <br>
<a id="18-31"></a> For who is God besides YHWH? <br>
And who is the Rock except our God? <br>
<a id="18-32"></a> It is God who arms me with strength <br>
and makes my way clear. <br>
<a id="18-33"></a> He makes my feet like those of a deer <br>
and stations me upon the heights. <br>
<a id="18-34"></a> He trains my hands for battle; <br>
my arms can bend a bow of bronze. <br>
<a id="18-35"></a> You have given me Your shield of salvation; <br>
Your right hand upholds me, <br>
and Your gentleness exalts me. <br>
<a id="18-36"></a> You broaden the path beneath me <br>
so that my ankles do not give way. <br>
<a id="18-37"></a> I pursued my enemies and overtook them; <br>
I did not turn back until they were consumed. <br>
<a id="18-38"></a> I crushed them so they could not rise; <br>
they have fallen under my feet. <br>
<a id="18-39"></a> You have armed me with strength for battle; <br>
You have subdued my foes beneath me. <br>
<a id="18-40"></a> You have made my enemies retreat before me; <br>
I put an end to those who hated me. <br>
<a id="18-41"></a> They cried for help, but there was no one to save them— <br>
to YHWH, but He did not answer. <br>
<a id="18-42"></a> I ground them as dust in the face of the wind; <br>
I trampled them like mud in the streets. <br>
<a id="18-43"></a> You have delivered me from the strife of the people; <br>
You have made me the head of nations; <br>
a people I had not known shall serve me. <br>
<a id="18-44"></a> When they hear me, they obey me; <br>
foreigners cower before me. <br>
<a id="18-45"></a> Foreigners lose heart <br>
and come trembling from their strongholds. <br>
<a id="18-46"></a> YHWH lives, and blessed be my Rock! <br>
And may the God of my salvation be exalted— <br>
<a id="18-47"></a> the God who avenges me <br>
and subdues nations beneath me, <br>
<a id="18-48"></a> who delivers me from my enemies. <br>
You exalt me above my foes; <br>
You rescue me from violent men. <br>
<a id="18-49"></a> Therefore I will praise You, O YHWH, among the nations; <br>
I will sing praises to Your name. <br>
<a id="18-50"></a> Great salvation He brings to His king. <br>
He shows loving devotion to His anointed, <br>
to David and his descendants forever. <br>

Let them not say, <br>

<a id="69-5"></a> <b>5</b> You know my folly, O God, <br>
and my guilt is not hidden from You. <br>
<a id="69-6"></a> <b>6</b> May those who hope in You not be ashamed through me, <br>
O Lord GOD of Hosts; <br>
may those who seek You not be dishonored through me, <br>
O God of Israel. <br>
<a id="69-7"></a> <b>7</b> For I have endured scorn for Your sake, <br>
and shame has covered my face. <br>
<a id="69-8"></a> <b>8</b> I have become a stranger to my brothers <br>
and a foreigner to my mother’s sons, <br>
<a id="69-9"></a> <b>9</b> because zeal for Your house has consumed me, <br>
and the insults of those who insult You have fallen on me. <br>
<a id="69-10"></a> <b>10</b> I wept and fasted, <br>
but it brought me reproach. <br>
<a id="69-11"></a> <b>11</b> I made sackcloth my clothing, <br>
and I was sport to them. <br>
<a id="69-12"></a> <b>12</b> Those who sit at the gate mock me, <br>
and I am the song of drunkards. <br>
<a id="69-13"></a> <b>13</b> But my prayer to You, O YHWH, <br>
is for a time of favor. <br>
In Your abundant loving devotion, O God, <br>
answer me with Your sure salvation. <br>
<a id="69-14"></a> <b>14</b> Rescue me from the mire <br>
and do not let me sink; <br>
deliver me from my foes <br>
and out of the deep waters. <br>
<a id="69-15"></a> <b>15</b> Do not let the floods engulf me <br>
or the depths swallow me up; <br>
let not the Pit close its mouth over me. <br>
<a id="69-16"></a> <b>16</b> Answer me, O YHWH, <br>
for Your loving devotion is good; <br>
turn to me in keeping with Your great compassion. <br>
<a id="69-17"></a> <b>17</b> Hide not Your face from Your servant, <br>
for I am in distress. <br>
Answer me quickly! <br>
<a id="69-18"></a> <b>18</b> Draw near to my soul and redeem me; <br>
ransom me because of my foes. <br>
<a id="69-19"></a> <b>19</b> You know my reproach, my shame and disgrace. <br>
All my adversaries are before You. <br>
<a id="69-20"></a> <b>20</b> Insults have broken my heart, <br>
and I am in despair. <br>
I looked for sympathy, but there was none, <br>
for comforters, but I found no one. <br>
<a id="69-21"></a> <b>21</b> They poisoned my food with gall <br>
and gave me vinegar to quench my thirst. <br>
<a id="69-22"></a> <b>22</b> May their table become a snare; <br>
may it be a retribution and a trap. <br>
<a id="69-23"></a> <b>23</b> May their eyes be darkened so they cannot see, <br>
and their backs be bent forever. <br>
<a id="69-24"></a> <b>24</b> Pour out Your wrath upon them, <br>
and let Your burning anger overtake them. <br>
<a id="69-25"></a> <b>25</b> May their place be deserted; <br>
let there be no one to dwell in their tents. <br>
<a id="69-26"></a> <b>26</b> For they persecute the one You struck <br>
and recount the pain of those You wounded. <br>
<a id="69-27"></a> <b>27</b> Add iniquity to their iniquity; <br>
let them not share in Your righteousness. <br>
<a id="69-28"></a> <b>28</b> May they be blotted out of the Book of Life <br>
and not listed with the righteous. <br>
<a id="69-29"></a> <b>29</b> But I am in pain and distress; <br>
let Your salvation protect me, O God. <br>
<a id="69-30"></a> <b>30</b> I will praise God’s name in song <br>
and exalt Him with thanksgiving. <br>
<a id="69-31"></a> <b>31</b> And this will please YHWH more than an ox, <br>
more than a bull with horns and hooves. <br>
<a id="69-32"></a> <b>32</b> The humble will see and rejoice. <br>
You who seek God, let your hearts be revived! <br>
<a id="69-33"></a> <b>33</b> For YHWH listens to the needy <br>
and does not despise His captive people. <br>
<a id="69-34"></a> <b>34</b> Let heaven and earth praise Him, <br>
the seas and everything that moves in them. <br>
<a id="69-35"></a> <b>35</b> For God will save Zion <br>
and rebuild the cities of Judah, <br>
that they may dwell there and possess it. <br>
<a id="69-36"></a> <b>36</b> The descendants of His servants will inherit it, <br>
and those who love His name will settle in it. <br>

<a id="73-1"></a> Surely God is good to Israel, <br>
to those who are pure in heart. <br>
<a id="73-2"></a> <b>2</b> But as for me, my feet had almost stumbled; <br>
my steps had nearly slipped. <br>
<a id="73-3"></a> <b>3</b> For I envied the arrogant <br>
when I saw the prosperity of the wicked.  <br>
<a id="73-4"></a> <b>4</b> They have no struggle in their death; <br>
their bodies are well-fed. <br>
<a id="73-5"></a> <b>5</b> They are free of the burdens others carry; <br>
they are not afflicted like other men. <br>
<a id="73-6"></a> <b>6</b> Therefore pride is their necklace; <br>
a garment of violence covers them. <br>
<a id="73-7"></a> <b>7</b> From their prosperity proceeds iniquity; <br>
the imaginations of their hearts run wild. <br>
<a id="73-8"></a> <b>8</b> They mock and speak with malice; <br>

<a id="73-9"></a> <b>9</b> They set their mouths against the heavens, <br>

Does the Most High have knowledge?” <br>
<a id="73-12"></a> <b>12</b> Behold, these are the wicked— <br>
always carefree as they increase their wealth.  <br>
<a id="73-13"></a> <b>13</b> Surely in vain I have kept my heart pure; <br>
in innocence I have washed my hands. <br>
<a id="73-14"></a> <b>14</b> For I am afflicted all day long <br>
and punished every morning. <br>
<a id="73-15"></a> <b>15</b> If I had said, “I will speak this way,” <br>
then I would have betrayed Your children. <br>
<a id="73-16"></a> <b>16</b> When I tried to understand all this, <br>
it was troublesome in my sight <br>
<a id="73-17"></a> <b>17</b> until I entered God’s sanctuary; <br>
then I discerned their end.  <br>
<a id="73-18"></a> <b>18</b> Surely You set them on slick ground; <br>
You cast them down into ruin. <br>
<a id="73-19"></a> <b>19</b> How suddenly they are laid waste, <br>
completely swept away by terrors! <br>
<a id="73-20"></a> <b>20</b> Like one waking from a dream, <br>
so You, O Lord, awaken and despise their form.  <br>
<a id="73-21"></a> <b>21</b> When my heart was grieved <br>
and I was pierced within, <br>
<a id="73-22"></a> <b>22</b> I was senseless and ignorant; <br>
I was a brute beast before You.  <br>
<a id="73-23"></a> <b>23</b> Yet I am always with You; <br>
You hold my right hand. <br>
<a id="73-24"></a> <b>24</b> You guide me with Your counsel, <br>
and later receive me in glory. <br>
<a id="73-25"></a> <b>25</b> Whom have I in heaven but You? <br>
And on earth I desire no one besides You. <br>
<a id="73-26"></a> <b>26</b> My flesh and my heart may fail, <br>
but God is the strength of my heart <br>
and my portion forever.  <br>
<a id="73-27"></a> <b>27</b> Those far from You will surely perish; <br>
You destroy all who are unfaithful to You. <br>
<a id="73-28"></a> <b>28</b> But as for me, it is good to draw near to God. <br>
I have made the Lord GOD my refuge, <br>
that I may proclaim all Your works. <br>

You fed him to the creatures of the desert. <br>
<a id="74-15"></a> <b>15</b> You broke open the fountain and the flood; <br>
You dried up the ever-flowing rivers. <br>
<a id="74-16"></a> <b>16</b> The day is Yours, and also the night; <br>
You established the moon and the sun. <br>
<a id="74-17"></a> <b>17</b> You set all the boundaries of the earth; <br>
You made the summer and winter. <br>
of Asaph. <br>
<a id="74-18"></a> <b>18</b> Remember how the enemy has mocked You, O YHWH, <br>
how a foolish people has spurned Your name. <br>

do not forget the lives of Your afflicted forever. <br>

<a id="77-1"></a> I cried out to God; <br>
I cried aloud to God to hear me. <br>
<a id="77-2"></a> <b>2</b> In the day of trouble I sought the Lord; <br>
through the night my outstretched hands did not grow weary; <br>
my soul refused to be comforted. <br>
<a id="77-3"></a> <b>3</b> I remembered You, O God, and I groaned; <br>
I mused and my spirit grew faint. <br>
Selah <br>
<a id="77-4"></a> <b>4</b> You have kept my eyes from closing; <br>
I am too troubled to speak. <br>
<a id="77-5"></a> <b>5</b> I considered the days of old, <br>
the years long in the past. <br>
<a id="77-6"></a> <b>6</b> At night I remembered my song; <br>
in my heart I mused, and my spirit pondered: <br>
<a id="77-7"></a> <b>7</b> “Will the Lord spurn us forever <br>
and never show His favor again? <br>
<a id="77-8"></a> <b>8</b> Is His loving devotion gone forever? <br>
Has His promise failed for all time? <br>
<a id="77-9"></a> <b>9</b> Has God forgotten to be gracious? <br>
Has His anger shut off His compassion?” <br>
Selah <br>
<a id="77-10"></a> <b>10</b> So I said, “I am grieved <br>
that the right hand of the Most High has changed.” <br>
<a id="77-11"></a> <b>11</b> I will remember the works of YHWH; <br>
yes, I will remember Your wonders of old. <br>
<a id="77-12"></a> <b>12</b> I will reflect on all You have done <br>

<a id="77-13"></a> <b>13</b> Your way, O God, is holy. <br>
What god is so great as our God? <br>
<a id="77-14"></a> <b>14</b> You are the God who works wonders; <br>
You display Your strength among the peoples. <br>
<a id="77-15"></a> <b>15</b> With power You redeemed Your people, <br>
the sons of Jacob and Joseph. <br>
Selah <br>
<a id="77-16"></a> <b>16</b> The waters saw You, O God; <br>
the waters saw You and swirled; <br>
even the depths were shaken. <br>
<a id="77-17"></a> <b>17</b> The clouds poured down water; <br>
the skies resounded with thunder; <br>
Your arrows flashed back and forth. <br>
<a id="77-18"></a> <b>18</b> Your thunder resounded in the whirlwind; <br>
the lightning lit up the world; <br>
the earth trembled and quaked. <br>
<a id="77-19"></a> <b>19</b> Your path led through the sea, <br>
Your way through the mighty waters, <br>

<a id="78-1"></a> <b>1</b> Give ear, O my people, to my instruction; <br>
listen to my words. <br>
<a id="78-2"></a> <b>2</b> I will open my mouth in parables; <br>
I will utter things hidden from the beginning, <br>
<a id="78-3"></a> <b>3</b> that we have heard and known <br>
and our fathers have relayed to us. <br>
<a id="78-4"></a> <b>4</b> We will not hide them from their children, <br>
but will declare to the next generation <br>
the praises of YHWH and His might, <br>
and the wonders He has performed. <br>
<a id="78-5"></a> <b>5</b> For He established a testimony in Jacob <br>
and appointed a law in Israel, <br>
which He commanded our fathers <br>
to teach to their children, <br>
<a id="78-6"></a> <b>6</b> that the coming generation would know them—even children
yet to be born—to arise and tell their own children <br>
<a id="78-7"></a> <b>7</b> that they should put their confidence in God, <br>
not forgetting His works, <br>
but keeping His commandments. <br>
<a id="78-8"></a> <b>8</b> Then they will not be like their fathers, <br>
a stubborn and rebellious generation, <br>
whose heart was not loyal, <br>
whose spirit was not faithful to God. <br>
<a id="78-9"></a> <b>9</b> The archers of Ephraim <br>
turned back on the day of battle. <br>
<a id="78-10"></a> <b>10</b> They failed to keep God’s covenant <br>
and refused to live by His law. <br>
<a id="78-11"></a> <b>11</b> They forgot what He had done, <br>
the wonders He had shown them. <br>
<a id="78-12"></a> <b>12</b> He worked wonders before their fathers <br>
in the land of Egypt, in the region of Zoan. <br>
<a id="78-13"></a> <b>13</b> He split the sea and brought them through; <br>
He set the waters upright like a wall. <br>
<a id="78-14"></a> <b>14</b> He led them with a cloud by day <br>
and with a light of fire all night. <br>
<a id="78-15"></a> <b>15</b> He split the rocks in the wilderness <br>
and gave them drink as abundant as the seas. <br>
<a id="78-16"></a> <b>16</b> He brought streams from the stone <br>
and made water flow down like rivers. <br>
<a id="78-17"></a> <b>17</b> But they continued to sin against Him, <br>
rebelling in the desert against the Most High. <br>
<a id="78-18"></a> <b>18</b> They willfully tested God <br>
by demanding the food they craved. <br>
<a id="78-19"></a> <b>19</b> They spoke against God, saying, “Can God really
prepare a table in the wilderness? <br>
<a id="78-20"></a> <b>20</b> When He struck the rock, water gushed out <br>
and torrents raged. But can He also give bread <br>
or supply His people with meat?” <br>
<a id="78-21"></a> <b>21</b> Therefore YHWH heard <br>
and was filled with wrath; <br>
so a fire was kindled against Jacob, <br>
and His anger flared against Israel, <br>
<a id="78-22"></a> <b>22</b> because they did not believe God <br>
or rely on His salvation. <br>
<a id="78-23"></a> <b>23</b> Yet He commanded the clouds above <br>
and opened the doors of the heavens. <br>
<a id="78-24"></a> <b>24</b> He rained down manna for them to eat; <br>
He gave them grain from heaven. <br>
<a id="78-25"></a> <b>25</b> Man ate the bread of angels; <br>
He sent them food in abundance. <br>
<a id="78-26"></a> <b>26</b> He stirred the east wind from the heavens <br>
and drove the south wind by His might. <br>
<a id="78-27"></a> <b>27</b> He rained meat on them like dust, <br>
and winged birds like the sand of the sea. <br>
<a id="78-28"></a> <b>28</b> He felled them in the midst of their camp, <br>
all around their dwellings. <br>
<a id="78-29"></a> <b>29</b> So they ate and were well filled, <br>
for He gave them what they craved. <br>
<a id="78-30"></a> <b>30</b> Yet before they had filled their desire, <br>
with the food still in their mouths, <br>
<a id="78-31"></a> <b>31</b> God’s anger flared against them, <br>
and He put to death their strongest <br>
and subdued the young men of Israel. <br>
<a id="78-32"></a> <b>32</b> In spite of all this, they kept on sinning; <br>
despite His wonderful works, they did not believe. <br>
<a id="78-33"></a> <b>33</b> So He ended their days in futility, <br>
and their years in sudden terror. <br>
<a id="78-34"></a> <b>34</b> When He slew them, they sought Him; <br>
they repented and searched for God. <br>
<a id="78-35"></a> <b>35</b> And they remembered that God was their Rock, <br>
that God Most High was their Redeemer. <br>
<a id="78-36"></a> <b>36</b> But they deceived Him with their mouths, <br>
and lied to Him with their tongues. <br>
<a id="78-37"></a> <b>37</b> Their hearts were disloyal to Him, <br>
and they were unfaithful to His covenant. <br>
<a id="78-38"></a> <b>38</b> And yet He was compassionate; <br>
He forgave their iniquity and did not destroy them. <br>
He often restrained His anger <br>
and did not unleash His full wrath. <br>
<a id="78-39"></a> <b>39</b> He remembered that they were but flesh, <br>
a passing breeze that does not return. <br>
<a id="78-40"></a> <b>40</b> How often they disobeyed Him in the wilderness <br>
and grieved Him in the desert! <br>
<a id="78-41"></a> <b>41</b> Again and again they tested God <br>
and provoked the Holy One of Israel. <br>
<a id="78-42"></a> <b>42</b> They did not remember His power— <br>
the day He redeemed them from the adversary, <br>
<a id="78-43"></a> <b>43</b> when He performed His signs in Egypt <br>
and His wonders in the fields of Zoan. <br>
<a id="78-44"></a> <b>44</b> He turned their rivers to blood, <br>
and from their streams they could not drink. <br>
<a id="78-45"></a> <b>45</b> He sent swarms of flies that devoured them, <br>
and frogs that devastated them. <br>
<a id="78-46"></a> <b>46</b> He gave their crops to the grasshopper, <br>
the fruit of their labor to the locust. <br>
<a id="78-47"></a> <b>47</b> He killed their vines with hailstones <br>
and their sycamore-figs with sleet. <br>
<a id="78-48"></a> <b>48</b> He abandoned their cattle to the hail <br>
and their livestock to bolts of lightning. <br>
<a id="78-49"></a> <b>49</b> He unleashed His fury against them, <br>
wrath, indignation, and calamity— <br>
a band of destroying angels. <br>
<a id="78-50"></a> <b>50</b> He cleared a path for His anger; <br>
He did not spare them from death <br>
but delivered their lives to the plague. <br>
<a id="78-51"></a> <b>51</b> He struck all the firstborn of Egypt, <br>
the virility in the tents of Ham. <br>
<a id="78-52"></a> <b>52</b> He led out His people like sheep <br>
and guided them like a flock in the wilderness. <br>
<a id="78-53"></a> <b>53</b> He led them safely, so they did not fear, <br>
but the sea engulfed their enemies. <br>
<a id="78-54"></a> <b>54</b> He brought them to His holy land, <br>
to the mountain His right hand had acquired. <br>
<a id="78-55"></a> <b>55</b> He drove out nations before them <br>
and apportioned their inheritance; <br>
He settled the tribes of Israel in their tents. <br>
<a id="78-56"></a> <b>56</b> But they tested and disobeyed God Most High, <br>
for they did not keep His decrees. <br>
<a id="78-57"></a> <b>57</b> They turned back and were faithless like their
fathers, <br>
twisted like a faulty bow. <br>
<a id="78-58"></a> <b>58</b> They enraged Him with their high places <br>
and provoked His jealousy with their idols. <br>
<a id="78-59"></a> <b>59</b> On hearing it, God was furious <br>
and rejected Israel completely. <br>
<a id="78-60"></a> <b>60</b> He abandoned the tabernacle of Shiloh, <br>
the tent He had pitched among men. <br>
<a id="78-61"></a> <b>61</b> He delivered His strength to captivity, <br>
and His splendor to the hand of the adversary. <br>
<a id="78-62"></a> <b>62</b> He surrendered His people to the sword <br>
because He was enraged by His heritage. <br>
<a id="78-63"></a> <b>63</b> Fire consumed His young men, <br>
and their maidens were left without wedding songs. <br>
<a id="78-64"></a> <b>64</b> His priests fell by the sword, <br>
but their widows could not lament. <br>
<a id="78-65"></a> <b>65</b> Then the Lord awoke as from sleep, <br>
like a mighty warrior overcome by wine. <br>
<a id="78-66"></a> <b>66</b> He beat back His foes; <br>
He put them to everlasting shame. <br>
<a id="78-67"></a> <b>67</b> He rejected the tent of Joseph <br>
and refused the tribe of Ephraim. <br>
<a id="78-68"></a> <b>68</b> But He chose the tribe of Judah, <br>
Mount Zion, which He loved. <br>
<a id="78-69"></a> <b>69</b> He built His sanctuary like the heights, <br>
like the earth He has established forever. <br>
<a id="78-70"></a> <b>70</b> He chose David His servant <br>
and took him from the sheepfolds; <br>
<a id="78-71"></a> <b>71</b> from tending the ewes He brought him <br>
to be shepherd of His people Jacob, <br>
of Israel His inheritance.

<a id="103-5"></a> <b>5</b> who satisfies you with good things, <br>
so that your youth is renewed like the eagle’s. <br>
<a id="103-6"></a> <b>6</b> YHWH executes righteousness <br>
and justice for all the oppressed. <br>
<a id="103-7"></a> <b>7</b> He made known His ways to Moses, <br>
His deeds to the people of Israel. <br>
<a id="103-8"></a> <b>8</b> YHWH is compassionate and gracious, <br>
slow to anger, abounding in loving devotion. <br>
<a id="103-9"></a> <b>9</b> He will not always accuse us, <br>
nor harbor His anger forever. <br>
<a id="103-10"></a> <b>10</b> He has not dealt with us according to our sins <br>
or repaid us according to our iniquities. <br>
<a id="103-11"></a> <b>11</b> For as high as the heavens are above the earth, <br>

He is mindful that we are dust. <br>
<a id="103-15"></a> <b>15</b> As for man, his days are like grass— <br>
he blooms like a flower of the field; <br>
<a id="103-16"></a> <b>16</b> when the wind passes over, it vanishes, <br>
and its place remembers it no more. <br>
<a id="103-17"></a> <b>17</b> But from everlasting to everlasting <br>
the loving devotion of YHWH <br>
extends to those who fear Him, <br>
and His righteousness to their children’s children— <br>
<a id="103-18"></a> <b>18</b> to those who keep His covenant <br>
and remember to obey His precepts. <br>
<a id="103-19"></a> <b>19</b> YHWH has established His throne in heaven, <br>

<a id="103-20"></a> <b>20</b> Bless YHWH, all His angels mighty in strength <br>
who carry out His word, <br>
who hearken to the voice of His command. <br>
<a id="103-21"></a> <b>21</b> Bless YHWH, all His hosts, <br>
you servants who do His will. <br>

<a id="104-1"></a> Bless YHWH, O my soul! <br>
O YHWH my God, You are very great; <br>
You are clothed with splendor and majesty. <br>
<a id="104-2"></a> <b>2</b> He wraps Himself in light as with a garment; <br>
He stretches out the heavens like a tent, <br>
<a id="104-3"></a> <b>3</b> laying the beams of His chambers <br>
in the waters above, <br>
making the clouds His chariot, <br>
walking on the wings of the wind. <br>
<a id="104-4"></a> <b>4</b> He makes the winds His messengers, <br>
flames of fire His servants. <br>
<a id="104-5"></a> <b>5</b> He set the earth on its foundations, <br>
never to be moved. <br>
<a id="104-6"></a> <b>6</b> You covered it with the deep like a garment; <br>
the waters stood above the mountains. <br>
<a id="104-7"></a> <b>7</b> At Your rebuke the waters fled; <br>
at the sound of Your thunder they hurried away— <br>
<a id="104-8"></a> <b>8</b> the mountains rose and the valleys sank <br>
to the place You assigned for them— <br>
<a id="104-9"></a> <b>9</b> You set a boundary they cannot cross, <br>
that they may never again cover the earth. <br>
<a id="104-10"></a> <b>10</b> He sends forth springs in the valleys; <br>
they flow between the mountains. <br>
<a id="104-11"></a> <b>11</b> They give drink to every beast of the field; <br>
the wild donkeys quench their thirst. <br>
<a id="104-12"></a> <b>12</b> The birds of the air nest beside the springs; <br>
they sing among the branches. <br>
<a id="104-13"></a> <b>13</b> He waters the mountains from His chambers; <br>
the earth is satisfied by the fruit of His works. <br>
<a id="104-14"></a> <b>14</b> He makes the grass grow for the livestock <br>
and provides crops for man to cultivate, <br>
bringing forth food from the earth: <br>
<a id="104-15"></a> <b>15</b> wine that gladdens the heart of man, <br>
oil that makes his face to shine, <br>
and bread that sustains his heart. <br>
<a id="104-16"></a> <b>16</b> The trees of YHWH have their fill, <br>
the cedars of Lebanon that He planted, <br>
<a id="104-17"></a> <b>17</b> where the birds build their nests; <br>
the stork makes her home in the cypresses. <br>
<a id="104-18"></a> <b>18</b> The high mountains are for the wild goats, <br>
the cliffs a refuge for the rock badgers. <br>
<a id="104-19"></a> <b>19</b> He made the moon to mark the seasons; <br>
the sun knows when to set. <br>
<a id="104-20"></a> <b>20</b> You bring darkness, and it becomes night, <br>
when all the beasts of the forest prowl. <br>
<a id="104-21"></a> <b>21</b> The young lions roar for their prey <br>
and seek their food from God. <br>
<a id="104-22"></a> <b>22</b> The sun rises, and they withdraw; <br>
they lie down in their dens. <br>
<a id="104-23"></a> <b>23</b> Man goes forth to his work <br>
and to his labor until evening. <br>
<a id="104-24"></a> <b>24</b> How many are Your works, O YHWH! <br>
In wisdom You have made them all; <br>
the earth is full of Your creatures. <br>
<a id="104-25"></a> <b>25</b> Here is the sea, vast and wide, <br>
teeming with creatures beyond number, <br>
living things both great and small. <br>
<a id="104-26"></a> <b>26</b> There the ships pass, <br>
and Leviathan, which You formed to frolic there. <br>
<a id="104-27"></a> <b>27</b> All creatures look to You <br>
to give them their food in due season. <br>
<a id="104-28"></a> <b>28</b> When You give it to them, <br>
they gather it up; <br>
when You open Your hand, <br>
they are satisfied with good things. <br>
<a id="104-29"></a> <b>29</b> When You hide Your face, <br>
they are terrified; <br>
when You take away their breath, <br>
they die and return to dust.  <br>
<a id="104-30"></a> <b>30</b> When You send Your Spirit, <br>
they are created, <br>
and You renewthe face of the earth.  <br>
<a id="104-31"></a> <b>31</b> May the glory of YHWH endure forever; <br>
may YHWH rejoice in His works.  <br>
<a id="104-32"></a> <b>32</b> He looks on the earth, <br>
and it trembles; <br>
He touches the mountains, <br>
and they smolder.  <br>
<a id="104-33"></a> <b>33</b> I will sing to YHWH all my life; <br>
I will sing praise to my God while I have my being.  <br>
<a id="104-34"></a> <b>34</b> May my meditation be pleasing to Him, <br>
for I rejoice in YHWH.  <br>
<a id="104-35"></a> <b>35</b> May sinners vanish from the earth <br>
and the wicked be no more. Bless YHWH, O my soul. Hallelujah!   <br>

<a id="105-4"></a> <b>4</b> Seek out YHWH and His strength; <br>

<a id="105-5"></a> <b>5</b> Remember the wonders He has done, <br>
His marvels, and the judgments He has pronounced, <br>
<a id="105-6"></a> <b>6</b> O offspring of His servant Abraham, <br>
O sons of Jacob, His chosen ones. <br>
<a id="105-7"></a> <b>7</b> He is YHWH our God; <br>
His judgments carry throughout the earth. <br>
<a id="105-8"></a> <b>8</b> He remembers His covenant forever, <br>
the word He ordained for a thousand generations— <br>
<a id="105-9"></a> <b>9</b> the covenant He made with Abraham, <br>
and the oath He swore to Isaac. <br>
<a id="105-10"></a> <b>10</b> He confirmed it to Jacob as a decree, <br>
to Israel as an everlasting covenant: <br>
<a id="105-11"></a> <b>11</b> “I will give you the land of Canaanas the portion of
your inheritance.” <br>
<a id="105-12"></a> <b>12</b> When they were few in number, <br>
few indeed, and strangers in the land, <br>
<a id="105-13"></a> <b>13</b> they wandered from nation to nation, <br>
from one kingdom to another. <br>
<a id="105-14"></a> <b>14</b> He let no man oppress them; <br>
He rebuked kings on their behalf: <br>
<a id="105-15"></a> <b>15</b> “Do not touch My anointed ones! <br>
Do no harm to My prophets!” <br>
<a id="105-16"></a> <b>16</b> He called down famine on the land <br>
and cut off all their supplies of food. <br>
<a id="105-17"></a> <b>17</b> He sent a man before them—Joseph, sold as a slave. <br>
<a id="105-18"></a> <b>18</b> They bruised his feet with shackles <br>
and placed his neck in irons, <br>
<a id="105-19"></a> <b>19</b> until his prediction came true <br>
and the word of YHWH proved him right. <br>
<a id="105-20"></a> <b>20</b> The king sent and released him; <br>
the ruler of peoples set him free. <br>
<a id="105-21"></a> <b>21</b> He made him master of his household, <br>
ruler over all his substance, <br>
<a id="105-22"></a> <b>22</b> to instruct his princes as he pleased <br>
and teach his elders wisdom. <br>
<a id="105-23"></a> <b>23</b> Then Israel entered Egypt; <br>
Jacob dwelt in the land of Ham. <br>
<a id="105-24"></a> <b>24</b> And YHWH made His people very fruitful, <br>
more numerous than their foes, <br>
<a id="105-25"></a> <b>25</b> whose hearts He turned to hate His people, <br>
to conspire against His servants. <br>
<a id="105-26"></a> <b>26</b> He sent Moses His servant, <br>
and Aaron, whom He had chosen. <br>
<a id="105-27"></a> <b>27</b> They performed His miraculous signs among them, <br>
and wonders in the land of Ham. <br>
<a id="105-28"></a> <b>28</b> He sent darkness, and it became dark—yet they defied
His words. <br>
<a id="105-29"></a> <b>29</b> He turned their waters to blood <br>
and caused their fish to die. <br>
<a id="105-30"></a> <b>30</b> Their land teemed with frogs, <br>
even in their royal chambers. <br>
<a id="105-31"></a> <b>31</b> He spoke, and insects swarmed—gnats throughout their
country. <br>
<a id="105-32"></a> <b>32</b> He gave them hail for rain, <br>
with lightning throughout their land. <br>
<a id="105-33"></a> <b>33</b> He struck their vines and fig trees <br>
and shattered the trees of their country. <br>
<a id="105-34"></a> <b>34</b> He spoke, and the locusts came—young locusts without
number. <br>
<a id="105-35"></a> <b>35</b> They devoured every plant in their land <br>
and consumed the produce of their soil. <br>
<a id="105-36"></a> <b>36</b> Then He struck all the firstborn in their land, <br>
the firstfruits of all their vigor. <br>
<a id="105-37"></a> <b>37</b> He brought Israel out with silver and gold, <br>
and none among His tribes stumbled. <br>
<a id="105-38"></a> <b>38</b> Egypt was glad when they departed, <br>
for the dread of Israel had fallen on them. <br>
<a id="105-39"></a> <b>39</b> He spread a cloud as a covering <br>
and a fire to light up the night. <br>
<a id="105-40"></a> <b>40</b> They asked, and He brought quailand satisfied them
with the bread of heaven. <br>
<a id="105-41"></a> <b>41</b> He opened a rock, and water gushed out; <br>
it flowed like a river in the desert. <br>

His chosen with shouts of joy. <br>
<a id="105-44"></a> <b>44</b> He gave them the lands of the nations, <br>

<span class="drop">106</span>
<a id="106-1"></a> Hallelujah! Give thanks to YHWH, for He is good; <br>
His loving devotion endures forever. <br>
<a id="106-2"></a> Who can describe the mighty acts of YHWH <br>
or fully proclaim His praise? <br>
<a id="106-3"></a> Blessed are those who uphold justice, <br>
who practice righteousness at all times. <br>
<a id="106-4"></a> Remember me, O YHWH, in Your favor to Your people; <br>
visit me with Your salvation, <br>
<a id="106-5"></a> that I may see the prosperity of Your chosen ones, <br>
and rejoice in the gladness of Your nation, <br>
and give glory with Your inheritance. <br>
<a id="106-6"></a> We have sinned like our fathers; <br>
we have done wrong and acted wickedly. <br>
<a id="106-7"></a> Our fathers in Egypt did not grasp Your wonders <br>
or remember Your abundant kindness; <br>
but they rebelled by the sea, <br>
there at the Red Sea. <br>
<a id="106-8"></a> Yet He saved them for the sake of His name, <br>
to make His power known. <br>
<a id="106-9"></a> He rebuked the Red Sea, and it dried up; <br>
He led them through the depths as through a desert. <br>
<a id="106-10"></a> He saved them from the hand that hated them; <br>
He redeemed them from the hand of the enemy. <br>
<a id="106-11"></a> The waters covered their foes; <br>
not one of them remained. <br>
<a id="106-12"></a> Then they believed His promises <br>
and sang His praise. <br>
<a id="106-13"></a> Yet they soon forgot His works <br>
and failed to wait for His counsel. <br>
<a id="106-14"></a> They craved intensely in the wilderness <br>
and tested God in the desert. <br>
<a id="106-15"></a> So He granted their request, <br>
but sent a wasting disease upon them. <br>
<a id="106-16"></a> In the camp they envied Moses, <br>
as well as Aaron, the holy one of YHWH. <br>
<a id="106-17"></a> The earth opened up and swallowed Dathan; <br>
it covered the assembly of Abiram. <br>
<a id="106-18"></a> Then fire blazed through their company; <br>
flames consumed the wicked. <br>
<a id="106-19"></a> At Horeb they made a calf <br>
and worshiped a molten image. <br>
<a id="106-20"></a> They exchanged their Glory <br>
for the image of a grass-eating ox. <br>
<a id="106-21"></a> They forgot God their Savior, <br>
who did great things in Egypt, <br>
<a id="106-22"></a> wondrous works in the land of Ham, <br>
and awesome deeds by the Red Sea. <br>
<a id="106-23"></a> So He said He would destroy them— <br>
had not Moses His chosen one <br>
stood before Him in the breach <br>
to divert His wrath from destroying them. <br>
<a id="106-24"></a> They despised the pleasant land; <br>
they did not believe His promise. <br>
<a id="106-25"></a> They grumbled in their tents <br>
and did not listen to the voice of YHWH. <br>
<a id="106-26"></a> So He raised His hand and swore <br>
to cast them down in the wilderness, <br>
<a id="106-27"></a> to disperse their offspring among the nations <br>
and scatter them throughout the lands. <br>
<a id="106-28"></a> They yoked themselves to Baal of Peor <br>
and ate sacrifices offered to lifeless gods. <br>
<a id="106-29"></a> So they provoked YHWH to anger with their deeds, <br>
and a plague broke out among them. <br>
<a id="106-30"></a> But Phinehas stood and intervened, <br>
and the plague was restrained. <br>
<a id="106-31"></a> It was credited to him as righteousness <br>
for endless generations to come. <br>
<a id="106-32"></a> At the waters of Meribah they angered YHWH, <br>
and trouble came to Moses because of them. <br>
<a id="106-33"></a> For they rebelled against His Spirit, <br>
and Moses spoke rashly with his lips. <br>
<a id="106-34"></a> They did not destroy the peoples <br>
as YHWH had commanded them, <br>
<a id="106-35"></a> but they mingled with the nations <br>
and adopted their customs. <br>
<a id="106-36"></a> They worshiped their idols, <br>
which became a snare to them. <br>
<a id="106-37"></a> They sacrificed their sons <br>
and their daughters to demons. <br>
<a id="106-38"></a> They shed innocent blood— <br>
the blood of their sons and daughters, <br>
whom they sacrificed to the idols of Canaan, <br>
and the land was polluted with blood. <br>
<a id="106-39"></a> They defiled themselves by their actions <br>
and prostituted themselves by their deeds. <br>
<a id="106-40"></a> So the anger of YHWH burned against His people, <br>
and He abhorred His own inheritance. <br>
<a id="106-41"></a> He delivered them into the hand of the nations, <br>
and those who hated them ruled over them. <br>
<a id="106-42"></a> Their enemies oppressed them, <br>
and subdued them under their hand. <br>
<a id="106-43"></a> Many times He rescued them, <br>
but they were bent on rebellion <br>
and sank down in their iniquity. <br>
<a id="106-44"></a> Nevertheless He heard their cry; <br>
He took note of their distress. <br>
<a id="106-45"></a> And He remembered His covenant with them, <br>
and relented by the abundance of His loving devotion. <br>
<a id="106-46"></a> He made them objects of compassion <br>
to all who held them captive. <br>
<a id="106-47"></a> Save us, O YHWH our God, <br>
and gather us from the nations, <br>
that we may give thanks to Your holy name, <br>
that we may glory in Your praise. <br>
<a id="106-48"></a> Blessed be YHWH, the God of Israel, <br>
from everlasting to everlasting. <br>
Let all the people say, “Amen!” Hallelujah! <br>

<a id="107-12"></a> He humbled their hearts with hard labor; <br>

<a id="107-13"></a> Then they cried out to YHWH in their trouble, <br>

be not silent. <br>
<a id="109-2"></a> For wicked and deceitful mouths open against me; <br>
they speak against me with lying tongues. <br>
<a id="109-3"></a> They surround me with hateful words <br>
and attack me without cause. <br>
<a id="109-4"></a> In return for my love they accuse me, <br>
but I am a man of prayer. <br>
<a id="109-5"></a> They repay me evil for good, <br>
and hatred for my love. <br>
<a id="109-6"></a> Set over him a wicked man; <br>
let an accuser stand at his right hand. <br>
<a id="109-7"></a> When he is tried, let him be found guilty, <br>

<a id="109-8"></a> May his days be few; <br>

<a id="109-16"></a> For he never thought to show kindness, <br>

<a id="109-17"></a> The cursing that he loved, may it fall on him; <br>
the blessing in which he refused to delight, may it be far from him.
<br>
<a id="109-18"></a> The cursing that he wore like a coat, may it soak into his
body like water, <br>

to those who speak evil against me. <br>
<a id="109-21"></a> But You, O GOD, the Lord, <br>
deal kindly with me for the sake of Your name; <br>
deliver me by the goodness of Your loving devotion. <br>
<a id="109-22"></a> For I am poor and needy; <br>
my heart is wounded within me. <br>

I am shaken off like a locust. <br>
<a id="109-24"></a> My knees are weak from fasting, <br>

<a id="109-25"></a> I am an object of scorn to my accusers; <br>
when they see me, they shake their heads. <br>
<a id="109-26"></a> Help me, O YHWH my God; <br>
save me according to Your loving devotion. <br>
<a id="109-27"></a> Let them know that this is Your hand, <br>
that You, O YHWH, have done it. <br>
<a id="109-28"></a> Though they curse, You will bless. <br>
When they rise up, they will be put to shame, <br>
but Your servant will rejoice. <br>
<a id="109-29"></a> May my accusers be clothed with disgrace; <br>
may they wear their shame like a robe. <br>
<a id="109-30"></a> With my mouth I will thank YHWH profusely; <br>
I will praise Him in the presence of many. <br>

<a id="147-1"></a> Hallelujah! How good it is to sing praises to our God,how pleasant and lovely to praise Him!   
<a id="147-2"></a> <b>2</b> YHWH builds up Jerusalem;He gathers the exiles of Israel.  
<a id="147-3"></a> <b>3</b> He heals the brokenheartedand binds up their wounds.  
<a id="147-4"></a> <b>4</b> He determines the number of the stars;He calls them each by name.  
<a id="147-5"></a> <b>5</b> Great is our Lord, and mighty in power;His understanding has no limit.  
<a id="147-6"></a> <b>6</b> YHWH sustains the humble,but casts the wicked to the ground.   
<a id="147-7"></a> <b>7</b> Sing to YHWH with thanksgiving;make music on the harp to our God,  
<a id="147-8"></a> <b>8</b> who covers the sky with clouds,who prepares rain for the earth,who makes grass to grow on the hills.  
<a id="147-9"></a> <b>9</b> He provides food for the animals,and for the young ravens when they call.   
<a id="147-10"></a> <b>10</b> He does not delight in the strength of the horse;He takes no pleasure in the legpower of the man.  
<a id="147-11"></a> <b>11</b> YHWH is pleased with those who fear Him,who hope in His loving devotion.   
<a id="147-12"></a> <b>12</b> Exalt YHWH, O Jerusalem;praise your God, O Zion!  
<a id="147-13"></a> <b>13</b> For He strengthens the bars of your gatesand blesses the children within you.  
<a id="147-14"></a> <b>14</b> He makes peace at your borders;He fills you with the finest wheat.   
<a id="147-15"></a> <b>15</b> He sends forth His command to the earth;His word runs swiftly.  
<a id="147-16"></a> <b>16</b> He spreads the snow like wool;He scatters the frost like ashes;  
<a id="147-17"></a> <b>17</b> He casts forth His hail like pebbles.Who can withstand His icy blast?  
<a id="147-18"></a> <b>18</b> He sends forth His word and melts them;He unleashes His winds, and the waters flow.   
<a id="147-19"></a> <b>19</b> He declares His word to Jacob,His statutes and judgments to Israel.  
<a id="147-20"></a> <b>20</b> He has done this for no other nation;they do not know His judgments. Hallelujah!

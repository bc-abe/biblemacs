<p>
<a id="1-9"></a> <b>9</b> I, John, your brother and partner in the tribulation and kingdom and perseverance that are in Jesus, was on the island of Patmos because of the word of God and my testimony about Jesus. 
<a id="1-10"></a> <b>10</b> On the Lord&rsquo;s day I was in the Spirit, and I heard behind me a loud voice like a trumpet, 
<a id="1-11"></a> <b>11</b> saying, “Write on a scroll what you see and send it to the seven churches: to Ephesus, Smyrna, Pergamum, Thyatira, Sardis, Philadelphia, and Laodicea.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="1-12"></a> <b>12</b> Then I turned to see the voice that was speaking with me. And having turned, I saw seven golden lampstands, 
<a id="1-13"></a> <b>13</b> and among the lampstands was One like the Son of Man, dressed in a long robe, with a golden sash around His chest. 
<a id="1-14"></a> <b>14</b> The hair of His head was white like wool, as white as snow, and His eyes were like a blazing fire. 
<a id="1-15"></a> <b>15</b> His feet were like polished bronze refined in a furnace, and His voice was like the roar of many waters. 
<a id="1-16"></a> <b>16</b> He held in His right hand seven stars, and a sharp double-edged sword came from His mouth. His face was like the sun shining at its brightest.
</p>

<p>
<a id="1-17"></a> <b>17</b> When I saw Him, I fell at His feet like a dead man. But He placed His right hand on me and said, “Do not be afraid. I am the First and the Last, 
<a id="1-18"></a> <b>18</b> the Living One. I was dead, and behold, now I am alive forever and ever! And I hold the keys of Death and of Hades.

<a id="1-19"></a> <b>19</b> Therefore write down the things you have seen, and the things that are, and the things that will happen after this. 
<a id="1-20"></a> <b>20</b> This is the mystery of the seven stars you saw in My right hand and of the seven golden lampstands: The seven stars are the angels of the seven churches, and the seven lampstands are the seven churches.

<a id="22-8"></a> <b>8</b> And I am John, who heard and saw these things. And when I had heard and seen them, I fell down to worship at the feet of the angel who had shown me these things. 
<a id="22-9"></a> <b>9</b> But he said to me, “Do not do that! I am a fellow servant with you and your brothers the prophets, and with those who keep the words of this book. Worship God!”
</p>

<p>
<a id="22-10"></a> <b>10</b> Then he told me, “Do not seal up the words of prophecy in this book, because the time is near. 
<a id="22-11"></a> <b>11</b> Let the unrighteous continue to be unrighteous, and the vile continue to be vile; let the righteous continue to practice righteousness, and the holy continue to be holy.”

<a id="22-14"></a> <b>14</b> Blessed are those who wash their robes, so that they may have the right to the tree of life and may enter the city by its gates. 
<a id="22-15"></a> <b>15</b> But outside are the dogs, the sorcerers, the sexually immoral, the murderers, the idolaters, and everyone who loves and practices falsehood.

<a id="22-18"></a> <b>18</b> I testify to everyone who hears the words of prophecy in this book: If anyone adds to them, God will add to him the plagues described in this book. 
<a id="22-19"></a> <b>19</b> And if anyone takes away from the words of this book of prophecy, God will take away his share in the tree of life and the holy city, which are described in this book.

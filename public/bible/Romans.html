<a id="1-1"></a> Paul, a servant of Christ Jesus, called to be an apostle, and set apart for the gospel of God&#x2014; 
<a id="1-2"></a> <b>2</b> the gospel He promised beforehand through His prophets in the Holy Scriptures, 
<a id="1-3"></a> <b>3</b> regarding His Son, who was a descendant of David according to the flesh, 
<a id="1-4"></a> <b>4</b> and who through the Spirit of holiness was declared with power to be the Son of God by His resurrection from the dead: Jesus Christ our Lord.
</p>

<p>
<a id="1-5"></a> <b>5</b> Through Him and on behalf of His name, we received grace and apostleship to call all those among the Gentiles to the obedience that comes from faith. 
<a id="1-6"></a> <b>6</b> And you also are among those who are called to belong to Jesus Christ.
</p>

<p>
<a id="1-7"></a> <b>7</b> To all in Rome who are loved by God and called to be saints:

<p>
Grace and peace to you from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgee086db">
<p>
<a id="1-8"></a> <b>8</b> First, I thank my God through Jesus Christ for all of you, because your faith is being proclaimed all over the world. 
<a id="1-9"></a> <b>9</b> God, whom I serve with my spirit in preaching the gospel of His Son, is my witness how constantly I remember you 
<a id="1-10"></a> <b>10</b> in my prayers at all times, asking that now at last by God&rsquo;s will I may succeed in coming to you. 
<a id="1-11"></a> <b>11</b> For I long to see you so that I may impart to you some spiritual gift to strengthen you, 
<a id="1-12"></a> <b>12</b> that is, that you and I may be mutually encouraged by each other&rsquo;s faith.
</p>

<p>
<a id="1-13"></a> <b>13</b> I do not want you to be unaware, brothers, how often I planned to come to you (but have been prevented from visiting until now), in order that I might have a harvest among you, just as I have had among the other Gentiles. 
<a id="1-14"></a> <b>14</b> I am obligated both to Greeks and non-Greeks, both to the wise and the foolish. 
<a id="1-15"></a> <b>15</b> That is why I am so eager to preach the gospel also to you who are in Rome.
</p>

<p>
<a id="1-16"></a> <b>16</b> I am not ashamed of the gospel, because it is the power of God for salvation to everyone who believes, first to the Jew, then to the Greek. 
<a id="1-17"></a> <b>17</b> For the gospel reveals the righteousness of God that comes by faith from start to finish, just as it is written: “The righteous will live by faith.”

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org926cf65">
<p>
<a id="1-18"></a> <b>18</b> The wrath of God is being revealed from heaven against all the godlessness and wickedness of men who suppress the truth by their wickedness. 
<a id="1-19"></a> <b>19</b> For what may be known about God is plain to them, because God has made it plain to them. 
<a id="1-20"></a> <b>20</b> For since the creation of the world God&rsquo;s invisible qualities, His eternal power and divine nature, have been clearly seen, being understood from His workmanship, so that men are without excuse.
</p>

<p>
<a id="1-21"></a> <b>21</b> For although they knew God, they neither glorified Him as God nor gave thanks to Him, but they became futile in their thinking and darkened in their foolish hearts. 
<a id="1-22"></a> <b>22</b> Although they claimed to be wise, they became fools, 
<a id="1-23"></a> <b>23</b> and exchanged the glory of the immortal God for images of mortal man and birds and animals and reptiles.
</p>

<p>
<a id="1-24"></a> <b>24</b> Therefore God gave them over in the desires of their hearts to impurity for the dishonoring of their bodies with one another. 
<a id="1-25"></a> <b>25</b> They exchanged the truth of God for a lie, and worshiped and served the creature rather than the Creator, who is forever worthy of praise! Amen.
</p>

<p>
<a id="1-26"></a> <b>26</b> For this reason God gave them over to dishonorable passions. Even their women exchanged natural relations for unnatural ones. 
<a id="1-27"></a> <b>27</b> Likewise, the men abandoned natural relations with women and burned with lust for one another. Men committed indecent acts with other men, and received in themselves the due penalty for their error.
</p>

<p>
<a id="1-28"></a> <b>28</b> Furthermore, since they did not see fit to acknowledge God, He gave them up to a depraved mind, to do what ought not to be done. 
<a id="1-29"></a> <b>29</b> They have become filled with every kind of wickedness, evil, greed, and depravity. They are full of envy, murder, strife, deceit, and malice. They are gossips, 
<a id="1-30"></a> <b>30</b> slanderers, God-haters, insolent, arrogant, and boastful. They invent new forms of evil; they disobey their parents. 
<a id="1-31"></a> <b>31</b> They are senseless, faithless, heartless, merciless.
</p>

<p>
<a id="1-32"></a> <b>32</b> Although they know God&rsquo;s righteous decree that those who do such things are worthy of death, they not only continue to do these things, but also approve of those who practice them.

</p>

<p>
<a id="2-1"></a> You, therefore, have no excuse, you who pass judgment on another. For on whatever grounds you judge the other, you are condemning yourself, because you who pass judgment do the same things. 
<a id="2-2"></a> <b>2</b> And we know that God&rsquo;s judgment against those who do such things is based on truth. 
<a id="2-3"></a> <b>3</b> So when you, O man, pass judgment on others, yet do the same things, do you think you will escape God&rsquo;s judgment? 
<a id="2-4"></a> <b>4</b> Or do you disregard the riches of His kindness, tolerance, and patience, not realizing that God&rsquo;s kindness leads you to repentance?
</p>

<p>
<a id="2-5"></a> <b>5</b> But because of your hard and unrepentant heart, you are storing up wrath against yourself for the day of wrath, when God&rsquo;s righteous judgment will be revealed. 
<a id="2-6"></a> <b>6</b> God “will repay each one according to his deeds.” 
<a id="2-7"></a> <b>7</b> To those who by perseverance in doing good seek glory, honor, and immortality, He will give eternal life. 
<a id="2-8"></a> <b>8</b> But for those who are self-seeking and who reject the truth and follow wickedness, there will be wrath and anger.
</p>

<p>
<a id="2-9"></a> <b>9</b> There will be trouble and distress for every human being who does evil, first for the Jew, then for the Greek; 
<a id="2-10"></a> <b>10</b> but glory, honor, and peace for everyone who does good, first for the Jew, then for the Greek. 
<a id="2-11"></a> <b>11</b> For God does not show favoritism.
</p>

<p>
<a id="2-12"></a> <b>12</b> All who sin apart from the law will also perish apart from the law, and all who sin under the law will be judged by the law. 
<a id="2-13"></a> <b>13</b> For it is not the hearers of the law who are righteous before God, but it is the doers of the law who will be declared righteous.
</p>

<p>
<a id="2-14"></a> <b>14</b> Indeed, when Gentiles, who do not have the law, do by nature what the law requires, they are a law to themselves, even though they do not have the law. 
<a id="2-15"></a> <b>15</b> So they show that the work of the law is written on their hearts, their consciences also bearing witness, and their thoughts either accusing or defending them 
<a id="2-16"></a> <b>16</b> on the day when God will judge men&rsquo;s secrets through Christ Jesus, as proclaimed by my gospel.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgfc32239">
<p>
<a id="2-17"></a> <b>17</b> Now you, if you call yourself a Jew; if you rely on the law and boast in God; 
<a id="2-18"></a> <b>18</b> if you know His will and approve of what is superior because you are instructed by the law; 
<a id="2-19"></a> <b>19</b> if you are convinced that you are a guide for the blind, a light for those in darkness, 
<a id="2-20"></a> <b>20</b> an instructor of the foolish, a teacher of infants, because you have in the law the embodiment of knowledge and truth&#x2014; 
<a id="2-21"></a> <b>21</b> you, then, who teach others, do you not teach yourself? You who preach against stealing, do you steal? 
<a id="2-22"></a> <b>22</b> You who forbid adultery, do you commit adultery? You who abhor idols, do you rob temples? 
<a id="2-23"></a> <b>23</b> You who boast in the law, do you dishonor God by breaking the law? 
<a id="2-24"></a> <b>24</b> As it is written: “God&rsquo;s name is blasphemed among the Gentiles because of you.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="2-25"></a> <b>25</b> Circumcision has value if you observe the law, but if you break the law, your circumcision has become uncircumcision. 
<a id="2-26"></a> <b>26</b> If a man who is not circumcised keeps the requirements of the law, will not his uncircumcision be regarded as circumcision? 
<a id="2-27"></a> <b>27</b> The one who is physically uncircumcised yet keeps the law will condemn you who, even though you have the written code and circumcision, are a lawbreaker.
</p>

<p>
<a id="2-28"></a> <b>28</b> A man is not a Jew because he is one outwardly, nor is circumcision only outward and physical. 
<a id="2-29"></a> <b>29</b> No, a man is a Jew because he is one inwardly, and circumcision is a matter of the heart, by the Spirit, not by the written code. Such a man&rsquo;s praise does not come from men, but from God.

<a id="3-1"></a> What, then, is the advantage of being a Jew? Or what is the value of circumcision?

<p>
<a id="3-3"></a> <b>3</b> What if some did not have faith? Will their lack of faith nullify God&rsquo;s faithfulness? 
<a id="3-4"></a> <b>4</b> Certainly not! Let God be true and every man a liar. As it is written:
</p>

<p>
“So that You may be proved right when You speak
</p>

<p>
and victorious when You judge.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="3-5"></a> <b>5</b> But if our unrighteousness highlights the righteousness of God, what shall we say? That God is unjust to inflict His wrath on us? I am speaking in human terms. 
<a id="3-6"></a> <b>6</b> Certainly not! In that case, how could God judge the world? 
<a id="3-7"></a> <b>7</b> However, if my falsehood accentuates God&rsquo;s truthfulness, to the increase of His glory, why am I still condemned as a sinner? 
<a id="3-8"></a> <b>8</b> Why not say, as some slanderously claim that we say, “Let us do evil that good may result”? Their condemnation is deserved!

<p>
<a id="3-21"></a> <b>21</b> But now, apart from the law, the righteousness of God has been revealed, as attested by the Law and the Prophets. 
<a id="3-22"></a> <b>22</b> And this righteousness from God comes through faith in Jesus Christ to all who believe. There is no distinction, 
<a id="3-23"></a> <b>23</b> for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God, 
<a id="3-24"></a> <b>24</b> and are justified freely by His grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus.
</p>

<p>
<a id="3-25"></a> <b>25</b> God presented Him as the atoning sacrifice through faith in His blood, in order to demonstrate His righteousness, because in His forbearance He had passed over the sins committed beforehand. 
<a id="3-26"></a> <b>26</b> He did this to demonstrate His righteousness at the present time, so as to be just and to justify the one who has faith in Jesus.

<a id="4-2"></a> <b>2</b> If Abraham was indeed justified by works, he had something to boast about, but not before God. 
<a id="4-3"></a> <b>3</b> For what does the Scripture say? “Abraham believed God, and it was credited to him as righteousness.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="4-4"></a> <b>4</b> Now the wages of the worker are not credited as a gift, but as an obligation. 
<a id="4-5"></a> <b>5</b> However, to the one who does not work, but believes in Him who justifies the wicked, his faith is credited as righteousness. 
<a id="4-6"></a> <b>6</b> And David speaks likewise of the blessedness of the man to whom God credits righteousness apart from works:
</p>

<p>
<a id="4-7"></a> <b>7</b> “Blessed are they whose lawless acts are forgiven,

<p>
whose sins are covered.

<p>
whose sin the Lord will never count against him.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="4-9"></a> <b>9</b> Is this blessing only on the circumcised, or also on the uncircumcised? We have been saying that Abraham&rsquo;s faith was credited to him as righteousness. 
<a id="4-10"></a> <b>10</b> In what context was it credited? Was it after his circumcision, or before? It was not after, but before.
</p>

<p>
<a id="4-11"></a> <b>11</b> And he received the sign of circumcision as a seal of the righteousness that he had by faith while he was still uncircumcised. So then, he is the father of all who believe but are not circumcised, in order that righteousness might be credited to them. 
<a id="4-12"></a> <b>12</b> And he is also the father of the circumcised who not only are circumcised, but who also walk in the footsteps of the faith that our father Abraham had before he was circumcised.

<a id="4-13"></a> <b>13</b> For the promise to Abraham and his offspring that he would be heir of the world was not given through the law, but through the righteousness that comes by faith. 
<a id="4-14"></a> <b>14</b> For if those who live by the law are heirs, faith is useless and the promise is worthless, 
<a id="4-15"></a> <b>15</b> because the law brings wrath. And where there is no law, there is no transgression.
</p>

<p>
<a id="4-16"></a> <b>16</b> Therefore, the promise comes by faith, so that it may rest on grace and may be guaranteed to all Abraham&rsquo;s offspring&#x2014;not only to those who are of the law, but also to those who are of the faith of Abraham. He is the father of us all. 
<a id="4-17"></a> <b>17</b> As it is written: “I have made you a father of many nations.” He is our father in the presence of God, in whom he believed, the God who gives life to the dead and calls into being what does not yet exist.
</p>

<p>
<a id="4-18"></a> <b>18</b> Against all hope, Abraham in hope believed and so became the father of many nations, just as he had been told, “So shall your offspring be.” 
<a id="4-19"></a> <b>19</b> Without weakening in his faith, he acknowledged the decrepitness of his body (since he was about a hundred years old) and the lifelessness of Sarah&rsquo;s womb. 
<a id="4-20"></a> <b>20</b> Yet he did not waver through disbelief in the promise of God, but was strengthened in his faith and gave glory to God, 
<a id="4-21"></a> <b>21</b> being fully persuaded that God was able to do what He had promised. 
<a id="4-22"></a> <b>22</b> This is why “it was credited to him as righteousness.”

<a id="5-12"></a> <b>12</b> Therefore, just as sin entered the world through one man, and death through sin, so also death was passed on to all men, because all sinned. 
<a id="5-13"></a> <b>13</b> For sin was in the world before the law was given; but sin is not taken into account when there is no law. 
<a id="5-14"></a> <b>14</b> Nevertheless, death reigned from Adam until Moses, even over those who did not sin in the way that Adam transgressed. He is a pattern of the One to come.
</p>

<p>
<a id="5-15"></a> <b>15</b> But the gift is not like the trespass. For if the many died by the trespass of the one man, how much more did God&rsquo;s grace and the gift that came by the grace of the one man, Jesus Christ, abound to the many! 
<a id="5-16"></a> <b>16</b> Again, the gift is not like the result of the one man&rsquo;s sin: The judgment that followed one sin brought condemnation, but the gift that followed many trespasses brought justification. 
<a id="5-17"></a> <b>17</b> For if, by the trespass of the one man, death reigned through that one man, how much more will those who receive an abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness reign in life through the one man, Jesus Christ!
</p>

<p>
<a id="5-18"></a> <b>18</b> So then, just as one trespass brought condemnation for all men, so also one act of righteousness brought justification and life for all men. 
<a id="5-19"></a> <b>19</b> For just as through the disobedience of the one man the many were made sinners, so also through the obedience of the one man the many will be made righteous.
</p>

<p>
<a id="5-20"></a> <b>20</b> The law came in so that the trespass would increase; but where sin increased, grace increased all the more, 
<a id="5-21"></a> <b>21</b> so that, just as sin reigned in death, so also grace might reign through righteousness to bring eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.

<p>
<a id="6-1"></a> What then shall we say? Shall we continue in sin so that grace may increase? 
<a id="6-2"></a> <b>2</b> Certainly not! How can we who died to sin live in it any longer? 
<a id="6-3"></a> <b>3</b> Or aren&rsquo;t you aware that all of us who were baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into His death? 
<a id="6-4"></a> <b>4</b> We were therefore buried with Him through baptism into death, in order that, just as Christ was raised from the dead through the glory of the Father, we too may walk in newness of life.
</p>

<p>
<a id="6-5"></a> <b>5</b> For if we have been united with Him like this in His death, we will certainly also be united with Him in His resurrection. 
<a id="6-6"></a> <b>6</b> We know that our old self was crucified with Him so that the body of sin might be rendered powerless, that we should no longer be slaves to sin. 
<a id="6-7"></a> <b>7</b> For anyone who has died has been freed from sin.
</p>

<p>
<a id="6-8"></a> <b>8</b> Now if we died with Christ, we believe that we will also live with Him. 
<a id="6-9"></a> <b>9</b> For we know that since Christ was raised from the dead, He cannot die again; death no longer has dominion over Him. 
<a id="6-10"></a> <b>10</b> The death He died, He died to sin once for all; but the life He lives, He lives to God. 
<a id="6-11"></a> <b>11</b> So you too must count yourselves dead to sin, but alive to God in Christ Jesus.
</p>

<p>
<a id="6-12"></a> <b>12</b> Therefore do not let sin reign in your mortal body so that you obey its desires. 
<a id="6-13"></a> <b>13</b> Do not present the parts of your body to sin as instruments of wickedness, but present yourselves to God as those who have been brought from death to life; and present the parts of your body to Him as instruments of righteousness.

<p>
<a id="6-19"></a> <b>19</b> I am speaking in human terms because of the weakness of your flesh. Just as you used to offer the parts of your body in slavery to impurity and to escalating wickedness, so now offer them in slavery to righteousness leading to holiness.

<a id="7-1"></a> Do you not know, brothers (for I am speaking to those who know the law), that the law has authority over a man only as long as he lives? 
<a id="7-2"></a> <b>2</b> For instance, a married woman is bound by law to her husband as long as he lives. But if her husband dies, she is released from the law of marriage. 
<a id="7-3"></a> <b>3</b> So then, if she is joined to another man while her husband is still alive, she is called an adulteress; but if her husband dies, she is free from that law and is not an adulteress, even if she marries another man.
</p>

<p>
<a id="7-4"></a> <b>4</b> Therefore, my brothers, you also died to the law through the body of Christ, that you might belong to another, to Him who was raised from the dead, in order that we might bear fruit to God. 
<a id="7-5"></a> <b>5</b> For when we lived according to the flesh, the sinful passions aroused by the law were at work in our bodies, bearing fruit for death. 
<a id="7-6"></a> <b>6</b> But now, having died to what bound us, we have been released from the law, so that we serve in the new way of the Spirit, and not in the old way of the written code.

<a id="7-7"></a> <b>7</b> What then shall we say? Is the law sin? Certainly not! Indeed, I would not have been mindful of sin if not for the law. For I would not have been aware of coveting if the law had not said, “Do not covet.” 
<a id="7-8"></a> <b>8</b> But sin, seizing its opportunity through the commandment, produced in me every kind of covetous desire. For apart from the law, sin is dead.
</p>

<p>
<a id="7-9"></a> <b>9</b> Once I was alive apart from the law; but when the commandment came, sin sprang to life and I died. 
<a id="7-10"></a> <b>10</b> So I discovered that the very commandment that was meant to bring life actually brought death. 
<a id="7-11"></a> <b>11</b> For sin, seizing its opportunity through the commandment, deceived me and through the commandment put me to death.
</p>

<p>
<a id="7-12"></a> <b>12</b> So then, the law is holy, and the commandment is holy, righteous, and good.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org1ce96a6">
<p>
<a id="7-13"></a> <b>13</b> Did that which is good, then, become death to me? Certainly not! But in order that sin might be exposed as sin, it produced death in me through what was good, so that through the commandment sin might become utterly sinful.
</p>

<p>
<a id="7-14"></a> <b>14</b> We know that the law is spiritual; but I am unspiritual, sold as a slave to sin. 
<a id="7-15"></a> <b>15</b> I do not understand what I do. For what I want to do, I do not do. But what I hate, I do. 
<a id="7-16"></a> <b>16</b> And if I do what I do not want to do, I admit that the law is good. 
<a id="7-17"></a> <b>17</b> In that case, it is no longer I who do it, but it is sin living in me that does it.
</p>

<p>
<a id="7-18"></a> <b>18</b> I know that nothing good lives in me, that is, in my flesh; for I have the desire to do what is good, but I cannot carry it out. 
<a id="7-19"></a> <b>19</b> For I do not do the good I want to do. Instead, I keep on doing the evil I do not want to do. 
<a id="7-20"></a> <b>20</b> And if I do what I do not want, it is no longer I who do it, but it is sin living in me that does it.
</p>

<p>
<a id="7-21"></a> <b>21</b> So this is the principle I have discovered: When I want to do good, evil is right there with me. 
<a id="7-22"></a> <b>22</b> For in my inner being I delight in God&rsquo;s law. 
<a id="7-23"></a> <b>23</b> But I see another law at work in my body, warring against the law of my mind and holding me captive to the law of sin that dwells within me.
</p>

<p>
<a id="7-24"></a> <b>24</b> What a wretched man I am! Who will rescue me from this body of death? 
<a id="7-25"></a> <b>25</b> Thanks be to God, through Jesus Christ our Lord!
</p>

<p>
So then, with my mind I serve the law of God, but with my flesh I serve the law of sin.

<a id="8-1"></a> Therefore, there is now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus. 
<a id="8-2"></a> <b>2</b> For in Christ Jesus the law of the Spirit of life set you free from the law of sin and death. 
<a id="8-3"></a> <b>3</b> For what the law was powerless to do in that it was weakened by the flesh, God did by sending His own Son in the likeness of sinful man, as an offering for sin. He thus condemned sin in the flesh, 
<a id="8-4"></a> <b>4</b> so that the righteous standard of the law might be fulfilled in us, who do not walk according to the flesh but according to the Spirit.
</p>

<p>
<a id="8-5"></a> <b>5</b> Those who live according to the flesh
set their minds on the things of the flesh;
but those who live according to the Spirit
set their minds on the things of the Spirit. 
<a id="8-6"></a> <b>6</b> The mind of the flesh is death,
but the mind of the Spirit is life and peace, 
<a id="8-7"></a> <b>7</b> because the mind of the flesh is hostile to God:
It does not submit to God&rsquo;s law,
nor can it do so. 
<a id="8-8"></a> <b>8</b> Those controlled by the flesh cannot please God.
</p>

<p>
<a id="8-9"></a> <b>9</b> You, however, are controlled not by the flesh,
but by the Spirit,
if the Spirit of God lives in you.
And if anyone does not have the Spirit of Christ,
he does not belong to Christ. 
<a id="8-10"></a> <b>10</b> But if Christ is in you,
your body is dead because of sin,
yet your spirit is alive because of righteousness. 
<a id="8-11"></a> <b>11</b> And if the Spirit of Him
who raised Jesus from the dead is living in you,
He who raised Christ Jesus from the dead
will also give life to your mortal bodies through His Spirit,
who lives in you.

you will die;

<p>
<a id="8-22"></a> <b>22</b> We know that the whole creation has been groaning together in the pains of childbirth until the present time. 
<a id="8-23"></a> <b>23</b> Not only that, but we ourselves, who have the firstfruits of the Spirit, groan inwardly as we wait eagerly for our adoption as sons, the redemption of our bodies.

<p>
<a id="8-26"></a> <b>26</b> In the same way, the Spirit helps us in our weakness. For we do not know how we ought to pray, but the Spirit Himself intercedes for us with groans too deep for words.

<p>
<a id="9-6"></a> <b>6</b> It is not as though God&rsquo;s word has failed. For not all who are descended from Israel are Israel. 
<a id="9-7"></a> <b>7</b> Nor because they are Abraham&rsquo;s descendants are they all his children. On the contrary, “Through Isaac your offspring will be reckoned.” 
<a id="9-8"></a> <b>8</b> So it is not the children of the flesh who are God&rsquo;s children, but it is the children of the promise who are regarded as offspring. 
<a id="9-9"></a> <b>9</b> For this is what the promise stated: “At the appointed time I will return, and Sarah will have a son.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="9-10"></a> <b>10</b> Not only that, but Rebecca&rsquo;s children were conceived by one man, our father Isaac. 
<a id="9-11"></a> <b>11</b> Yet before the twins were born or had done anything good or bad, in order that God&rsquo;s plan of election might stand, 
<a id="9-12"></a> <b>12</b> not by works but by Him who calls, she was told, “The older will serve the younger.” 
<a id="9-13"></a> <b>13</b> So it is written: “Jacob I loved, but Esau I hated.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="9-14"></a> <b>14</b> What then shall we say? Is God unjust? Certainly not! 
<a id="9-15"></a> <b>15</b> For He says to Moses:
</p>

<p>
“I will have mercy on whom I have mercy,
</p>

<p>
and I will have compassion on whom I have compassion.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="9-16"></a> <b>16</b> So then, it does not depend on man&rsquo;s desire or effort, but on God&rsquo;s mercy. 
<a id="9-17"></a> <b>17</b> For the Scripture says to Pharaoh: “I raised you up for this very purpose, that I might display My power in you, and that My name might be proclaimed in all the earth.” 
<a id="9-18"></a> <b>18</b> Therefore God has mercy on whom He wants to have mercy, and He hardens whom He wants to harden.

<a id="9-21"></a> <b>21</b> Does not the potter have the right to make from the same lump of clay one vessel for special occasions and another for common use?
</p>

<p>
<a id="9-22"></a> <b>22</b> What if God, intending to show His wrath and make His power known, bore with great patience the vessels of His wrath, prepared for destruction? 
<a id="9-23"></a> <b>23</b> What if He did this to make the riches of His glory known to the vessels of His mercy, whom He prepared in advance for glory&#x2014; 
<a id="9-24"></a> <b>24</b> including us, whom He has called not only from the Jews, but also from the Gentiles? 
<a id="9-25"></a> <b>25</b> As He says in Hosea:

“It will happen that in the very place where it was said to them, <br>

<span class="drop">10</span>
</p>

<p>
<a id="10-1"></a> Brothers, my heart&rsquo;s desire and prayer to God for the Israelites is for their salvation. 
<a id="10-2"></a> <b>2</b> For I testify about them that they are zealous for God, but not on the basis of knowledge. 
<a id="10-3"></a> <b>3</b> Because they were ignorant of God&rsquo;s righteousness and sought to establish their own, they did not submit to God&rsquo;s righteousness. 
<a id="10-4"></a> <b>4</b> For Christ is the end of the law, to bring righteousness to everyone who believes.
</p>

<p>
<a id="10-5"></a> <b>5</b> For concerning the righteousness that is by the law, Moses writes: “The man who does these things will live by them.” 
<a id="10-6"></a> <b>6</b> But the righteousness that is by faith says: “Do not say in your heart, ‘Who will ascend into heaven?&rsquo; (that is, to bring Christ down) 
<a id="10-7"></a> <b>7</b> or, ‘Who will descend into the Abyss?&rsquo; (that is, to bring Christ up from the dead).”
</p>

<p>
<a id="10-8"></a> <b>8</b> But what does it say? “The word is near you; it is in your mouth and in your heart,” that is, the word of faith we are proclaiming: 
<a id="10-9"></a> <b>9</b> that if you confess with your mouth, “Jesus is Lord,” and believe in your heart that God raised Him from the dead, you will be saved. 
<a id="10-10"></a> <b>10</b> For with your heart you believe and are justified, and with your mouth you confess and are saved.
</p>

<p>
<a id="10-11"></a> <b>11</b> It is just as the Scripture says: “Anyone who believes in Him will never be put to shame.” 
</p>

<p>
<a id="10-12"></a> <b>12</b> For there is no difference between Jew and Greek: The same Lord is Lord of all, and gives richly to all who call on Him, 
<a id="10-13"></a> <b>13</b> for, “Everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="10-14"></a> <b>14</b> How then can they call on the One in whom they have not believed? And how can they believe in the One of whom they have not heard? And how can they hear without someone to preach? 
<a id="10-15"></a> <b>15</b> And how can they preach unless they are sent? As it is written: “How beautiful are the feet of those who bring good news!”
</p>

<p>
<a id="10-16"></a> <b>16</b> But not all of them welcomed the good news. For Isaiah says, “Lord, who has believed our message?” 
<a id="10-17"></a> <b>17</b> Consequently, faith comes by hearing, and hearing by the word of Christ.
</p>

<p>
<a id="10-18"></a> <b>18</b> But I ask, did they not hear? Indeed they did:
</p>

<p>
“Their voice has gone out into all the earth, \
their words to the ends of the world.” <br>
</p>

<p>
<a id="10-19"></a> <b>19</b> I ask instead, did Israel not understand? First, Moses says:
“I will make you jealous by those who are not a nation;
I will make you angry by a nation without understanding.”
<a id="10-20"></a> <b>20</b> And Isaiah boldly says:
</p>

<p>
“I was found by those who did not seek Me; <br>
I revealed Myself to those who did not ask for Me.” <br>
</p>

<p>
<a id="10-21"></a> <b>21</b> But as for Israel he says:
</p>

<p>
“All day long I have held out My hands <br>
to a disobedient and obstinate people.” <br>

<p>
<a id="11-1"></a> I ask then, did God reject His people? Certainly not! I am an Israelite myself, a descendant of Abraham, from the tribe of Benjamin. 
<a id="11-2"></a> <b>2</b> God did not reject His people, whom He foreknew. Do you not know what the Scripture says about Elijah, how he appealed to God against Israel:
<a id="11-3"></a> <b>3</b> “Lord, they have killed Your prophets and torn down Your altars. I am the only one left, and they are seeking my life as well”? 
</p>

<p>
<a id="11-4"></a> <b>4</b> And what was the divine reply to him? “I have reserved for Myself seven thousand men who have not bowed the knee to Baal.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="11-5"></a> <b>5</b> In the same way, at the present time there is a remnant chosen by grace. 
<a id="11-6"></a> <b>6</b> And if it is by grace, then it is no longer by works. Otherwise, grace would no longer be grace.
</p>

<p>
<a id="11-7"></a> <b>7</b> What then? What Israel was seeking, it failed to obtain, but the elect did. The others were hardened, 
<a id="11-8"></a> <b>8</b> as it is written:
</p>

<p>
“God gave them a spirit of stupor, <br>
eyes that could not see, <br>
and ears that could not hear, <br>
to this very day.” <br>
</p>

<p>
<a id="11-9"></a> <b>9</b> And David says:
</p>

<p>
“May their table become a snare and a trap, <br>
a stumbling block and a retribution to them. <br>
<a id="11-10"></a> <b>10</b> May their eyes be darkened so they cannot see, <br>
and their backs be bent forever.”  <br>

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org3b5f8c9">
<p>
<a id="11-11"></a> <b>11</b> I ask then, did they stumble so as to fall beyond recovery? Certainly not! However, because of their trespass, salvation has come to the Gentiles to make Israel jealous. 
<a id="11-12"></a> <b>12</b> But if their trespass means riches for the world, and their failure means riches for the Gentiles, how much greater riches will their fullness bring!
</p>

<p>
<a id="11-13"></a> <b>13</b> I am speaking to you Gentiles. Inasmuch as I am the apostle to the Gentiles, I magnify my ministry 
<a id="11-14"></a> <b>14</b> in the hope that I may provoke my own people to jealousy and save some of them. 
<a id="11-15"></a> <b>15</b> For if their rejection is the reconciliation of the world, what will their acceptance be but life from the dead? 
<a id="11-16"></a> <b>16</b> If the first part of the dough is holy, so is the whole batch; if the root is holy, so are the branches.
</p>

<p>
<a id="11-17"></a> <b>17</b> Now if some branches have been broken off, and you, a wild olive shoot, have been grafted in among the others to share in the nourishment of the olive root, 
<a id="11-18"></a> <b>18</b> do not boast over those branches. If you do, remember this: You do not support the root, but the root supports you.
</p>

<p>
<a id="11-19"></a> <b>19</b> You will say then, “Branches were broken off so that I could be grafted in.” 
<a id="11-20"></a> <b>20</b> That is correct: They were broken off because of unbelief, but you stand by faith. Do not be arrogant, but be afraid. 
<a id="11-21"></a> <b>21</b> For if God did not spare the natural branches, He will certainly not spare you either.
</p>

<p>
<a id="11-22"></a> <b>22</b> Take notice, therefore, of the kindness and severity of God: severity to those who fell, but kindness to you, if you continue in His kindness. Otherwise you also will be cut off. 
<a id="11-23"></a> <b>23</b> And if they do not persist in unbelief, they will be grafted in, for God is able to graft them in again. 
<a id="11-24"></a> <b>24</b> For if you were cut from a wild olive tree, and contrary to nature were grafted into one that is cultivated, how much more readily will these, the natural branches, be grafted into their own olive tree!

<p>
<a id="15-1"></a> We who are strong ought to bear with the shortcomings of the weak and not to please ourselves. 
<a id="15-2"></a> <b>2</b> Each of us should please his neighbor for his good, to build him up. 
<a id="15-3"></a> <b>3</b> For even Christ did not please Himself, but as it is written: “The insults of those who insult You have fallen on Me.” 
<a id="15-4"></a> <b>4</b> For everything that was written in the past was written for our instruction, so that through endurance and the encouragement of the Scriptures, we might have hope.
</p>

<p>
<a id="15-5"></a> <b>5</b> Now may the God who gives endurance and encouragement grant you harmony with one another in Christ Jesus, 
<a id="15-6"></a> <b>6</b> so that with one mind and one voice you may glorify the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgbecf151">
<p>
<a id="15-7"></a> <b>7</b> Accept one another, then, just as Christ accepted you, in order to bring glory to God. 
<a id="15-8"></a> <b>8</b> For I tell you that Christ has become a servant of the circumcised on behalf of God&rsquo;s truth, to confirm the promises made to the patriarchs, 
<a id="15-9"></a> <b>9</b> so that the Gentiles may glorify God for His mercy. As it is written:
</p>

<p>
“Therefore I will praise You among the Gentiles;
</p>

<p>
I will sing hymns to Your name.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="15-10"></a> <b>10</b> Again, it says:
</p>

<p>
“Rejoice, O Gentiles, with His people.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="15-11"></a> <b>11</b> And again:
</p>

<p>
“Praise the Lord, all you Gentiles,
</p>

<p>
and extol Him, all you peoples.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="15-12"></a> <b>12</b> And once more, Isaiah says:
</p>

<p>
“The Root of Jesse will appear,
</p>

<p>
One who will arise to rule over the Gentiles;
</p>

<p>
in Him the Gentiles will put their hope.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="15-13"></a> <b>13</b> Now may the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace as you believe in Him, so that you may overflow with hope by the power of the Holy Spirit.

<h3 id="org387f64a">Paul the Minister to the Gentiles</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org387f64a">
<p>
<a id="15-14"></a> <b>14</b> I myself am convinced, my brothers, that you yourselves are full of goodness, brimming with knowledge, and able to instruct one another. 
<a id="15-15"></a> <b>15</b> However, I have written you a bold reminder on some points, because of the grace God has given me 
<a id="15-16"></a> <b>16</b> to be a minister of Christ Jesus to the Gentiles in the priestly service of the gospel of God, so that the Gentiles might become an offering acceptable to God, sanctified by the Holy Spirit.
</p>

<p>
<a id="15-17"></a> <b>17</b> Therefore I exult in Christ Jesus in my service to God. 
<a id="15-18"></a> <b>18</b> I will not presume to speak of anything except what Christ has accomplished through me in leading the Gentiles to obedience by word and deed, 
<a id="15-19"></a> <b>19</b> by the power of signs and wonders, and by the power of the Spirit of God. So from Jerusalem all the way around to Illyricum, I have fully proclaimed the gospel of Christ.
</p>

<p>
<a id="15-20"></a> <b>20</b> In this way I have aspired to preach the gospel where Christ was not known, so that I would not be building on someone else&rsquo;s foundation. 
<a id="15-21"></a> <b>21</b> Rather, as it is written:
</p>

<p>
“Those who were not told about Him will see,
</p>

<p>
and those who have not heard will understand.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="15-22"></a> <b>22</b> That is why I have often been hindered from coming to you.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgdd65a96">
<p>
<a id="15-23"></a> <b>23</b> But now that there are no further opportunities for me in these regions, and since I have longed for many years to visit you, 
<a id="15-24"></a> <b>24</b> I hope to see you on my way to Spain. And after I have enjoyed your company for a while, you can equip me for my journey.
</p>

<p>
<a id="15-25"></a> <b>25</b> Now, however, I am on my way to Jerusalem to serve the saints there. 
<a id="15-26"></a> <b>26</b> For Macedonia and Achaia were pleased to make a contribution for the poor among the saints in Jerusalem. 
<a id="15-27"></a> <b>27</b> They were pleased to do it, and indeed they owe it to them. For if the Gentiles have shared in their spiritual blessings, they are obligated to minister to them with material blessings.
</p>

<p>
<a id="15-28"></a> <b>28</b> So after I have completed this service and have safely delivered this bounty to them, I will set off to Spain by way of you. 
<a id="15-29"></a> <b>29</b> I know that when I come to you, I will come in the fullness of the blessing of Christ.
</p>

<p>
<a id="15-30"></a> <b>30</b> Now I urge you, brothers, by our Lord Jesus Christ and by the love of the Spirit, to join me in my struggle by praying to God for me. 
<a id="15-31"></a> <b>31</b> Pray that I may be delivered from the unbelievers in Judea, and that my service in Jerusalem may be acceptable to the saints there, 
<a id="15-32"></a> <b>32</b> so that by God&rsquo;s will I may come to you with joy and together with you be refreshed.
</p>

<p>
<a id="15-33"></a> <b>33</b> The God of peace be with all of you. Amen.

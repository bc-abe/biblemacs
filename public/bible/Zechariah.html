<a id="1-1"></a> In the eighth month of the second year of Darius, the word of the LORD came to the prophet Zechariah son of Berechiah, the son of Iddo, saying:

<p>
<a id="1-2"></a> <b>2</b> “The LORD was very angry with your fathers. 
<a id="1-3"></a> <b>3</b> So tell the people that this is what the LORD of Hosts says: ‘Return to Me, declares the LORD of Hosts, and I will return to you, says the LORD of Hosts.&rsquo;
</p>

<p>
<a id="1-4"></a> <b>4</b> Do not be like your fathers, to whom the former prophets proclaimed that this is what the LORD of Hosts says: ‘Turn now from your evil ways and deeds.&rsquo;
</p>

<p>
But they did not listen or pay attention to Me, declares the LORD.
</p>

<p>
<a id="1-5"></a> <b>5</b> Where are your fathers now? And the prophets, do they live forever? 
<a id="1-6"></a> <b>6</b> But did not My words and My statutes, which I commanded My servants the prophets, overtake your fathers? They repented and said, ‘Just as the LORD of Hosts purposed to do to us according to our ways and deeds, so He has done to us.&rsquo; ”

<p>
<a id="1-7"></a> <b>7</b> On the twenty-fourth day of the eleventh month, the month of Shebat, in the second year of Darius, the word of the LORD came to the prophet Zechariah son of Berechiah, the son of Iddo.
</p>

<p>
<a id="1-8"></a> <b>8</b> I looked out into the night and saw a man riding on a red horse. He was standing among the myrtle trees in the hollow, and behind him were red, sorrel, and white horses.
</p>

<p>
<a id="1-9"></a> <b>9</b> “What are these, my lord?” I asked.
</p>

<p>
And the angel who was speaking with me replied, “I will show you what they are.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="1-10"></a> <b>10</b> Then the man standing among the myrtle trees explained, “They are the ones the LORD has sent to patrol the earth.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="1-11"></a> <b>11</b> And the riders answered the angel of the LORD who was standing among the myrtle trees, “We have patrolled the earth, and behold, all the earth is at rest and tranquil.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="1-12"></a> <b>12</b> Then the angel of the LORD said, “How long, O LORD of Hosts, will You withhold mercy from Jerusalem and the cities of Judah, with which You have been angry these seventy years?”
</p>

<p>
<a id="1-13"></a> <b>13</b> So the LORD spoke kind and comforting words to the angel who was speaking with me.
</p>

<p>
<a id="1-14"></a> <b>14</b> Then the angel who was speaking with me said, “Proclaim this word: This is what the LORD of Hosts says: ‘I am very jealous for Jerusalem and Zion, 
<a id="1-15"></a> <b>15</b> but I am fiercely angry with the nations that are at ease. For I was a little angry, but they have added to the calamity.&rsquo;
</p>

<p>
<a id="1-16"></a> <b>16</b> Therefore this is what the LORD says: ‘I will return to Jerusalem with mercy, and there My house will be rebuilt, declares the LORD of Hosts, and a measuring line will be stretched out over Jerusalem.&rsquo;
</p>

<p>
<a id="1-17"></a> <b>17</b> Proclaim further that this is what the LORD of Hosts says: ‘My cities will again overflow with prosperity; the LORD will again comfort Zion and choose Jerusalem.&rsquo; ”

<a id="1-18"></a> <b>18</b> Then I looked up and saw four horns. 
<a id="1-19"></a> <b>19</b> So I asked the angel who was speaking with me, “What are these?”
</p>

<p>
And he told me, “These are the horns that have scattered Judah, Israel, and Jerusalem.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="1-20"></a> <b>20</b> Then the LORD showed me four craftsmen.
</p>

<p>
<a id="1-21"></a> <b>21</b> “What are these coming to do?” I asked.
</p>

<p>
And He replied, “These are the horns that scattered Judah so that no one could raise his head; but the craftsmen have come to terrify them and throw down these horns of the nations that have lifted up their horns against the land of Judah to scatter it.”

“To measure Jerusalem,” he replied, “and to determine its width and length.”

“I see a solid gold lampstand,” I replied, “with a bowl at the top and seven lamps on it, with seven spouts to the lamps.

<p>
<a id="7-4"></a> <b>4</b> Then the word of the LORD of Hosts came to me, saying,

<p>
<a id="7-11"></a> <b>11</b> But they refused to pay attention and turned a stubborn shoulder; they stopped up their ears from hearing. 
<a id="7-12"></a> <b>12</b> They made their hearts like flint and would not listen to the law or to the words that the LORD of Hosts had sent by His Spirit through the earlier prophets. Therefore great anger came from the LORD of Hosts.

<a id="7-13"></a> <b>13</b> And just as I had called and they would not listen, so when they called I would not listen, says the LORD of Hosts.

<a id="14-1"></a> Behold, a day of the LORD is coming when your plunder will be divided in your presence. 
<a id="14-2"></a> <b>2</b> For I will gather all the nations for battle against Jerusalem, and the city will be captured, the houses looted, and the women ravished. Half of the city will go into exile, but the rest of the people will not be removed from the city.
</p>

<p>
<a id="14-3"></a> <b>3</b> Then the LORD will go out to fight against those nations, as He fights in the day of battle. 
<a id="14-4"></a> <b>4</b> On that day His feet will stand on the Mount of Olives, east of Jerusalem, and the Mount of Olives will be split in two from east to west, forming a great valley, with half the mountain moving to the north and half to the south. 
<a id="14-5"></a> <b>5</b> You will flee by My mountain valley, for it will extend to Azal. You will flee as you fled from the earthquake in the days of Uzziah king of Judah. Then the LORD my God will come, and all the holy ones with Him.
</p>

<p>
<a id="14-6"></a> <b>6</b> On that day there will be no light, no cold or frost. 
<a id="14-7"></a> <b>7</b> It will be a day known only to the LORD, without day or night; but when evening comes, there will be light.
</p>

<p>
<a id="14-8"></a> <b>8</b> And on that day living water will flow out from Jerusalem, half of it toward the Eastern Sea and the other half toward the Western Sea, in summer and winter alike. 
<a id="14-9"></a> <b>9</b> On that day the LORD will become King over all the earth&#x2014;the LORD alone, and His name alone.
</p>

<p>
<a id="14-10"></a> <b>10</b> All the land from Geba to Rimmon south of Jerusalem will be turned into a plain, but Jerusalem will be raised up and will remain in her place, from the Benjamin Gate to the site of the First Gate to the Corner Gate, and from the Tower of Hananel to the royal winepresses. 
<a id="14-11"></a> <b>11</b> People will live there, and never again will there be an utter destruction. So Jerusalem will dwell securely.
</p>

<p>
<a id="14-12"></a> <b>12</b> And this will be the plague with which the LORD strikes all the peoples who have warred against Jerusalem: Their flesh will rot while they stand on their feet, their eyes will rot in their sockets, and their tongues will rot in their mouths.
</p>

<p>
<a id="14-13"></a> <b>13</b> On that day a great panic from the LORD will come upon them, so that each will seize the hand of another, and the hand of one will rise against the other. 
<a id="14-14"></a> <b>14</b> Judah will also fight at Jerusalem, and the wealth of all the surrounding nations will be collected&#x2014;gold, silver, and apparel in great abundance. 
<a id="14-15"></a> <b>15</b> And a similar plague will strike the horses and mules, camels and donkeys, and all the animals in those camps.

<h3 id="org18a0beb">All Nations Will Worship the King (Leviticus 23:33&#x2013;44; Nehemiah 8:13&#x2013;18)</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org18a0beb">
<p>
<a id="14-16"></a> <b>16</b> Then all the survivors from the nations that came against Jerusalem will go up year after year to worship the King, the LORD of Hosts, and to celebrate the Feast of Tabernacles. 
<a id="14-17"></a> <b>17</b> And should any of the families of the earth not go up to Jerusalem to worship the King, the LORD of Hosts, then the rain will not fall on them. 
<a id="14-18"></a> <b>18</b> And if the people of Egypt will not go up and enter in, then the rain will not fall on them; this will be the plague with which the LORD strikes the nations who do not go up to celebrate the Feast of Tabernacles. 
<a id="14-19"></a> <b>19</b> This will be the punishment of Egypt and of all the nations that do not go up to celebrate the Feast of Tabernacles.
</p>

<p>
<a id="14-20"></a> <b>20</b> On that day, HOLY TO THE LORD will be inscribed on the bells of the horses, and the cooking pots in the house of the LORD will be like the sprinkling bowls before the altar. 
<a id="14-21"></a> <b>21</b> Indeed, every pot in Jerusalem and Judah will be holy to the LORD of Hosts, and all who sacrifice will come and take some pots and cook in them. And on that day there will no longer be a Canaanite in the house of the LORD of Hosts.
